# OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


#### CHAPTER 1. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

OpenShift Container Platform is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform. The foundation of
OpenShift Container Platform is based on Kubernetes and therefore shares the same technology. To
learn more about OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes, see product architecture.

###### 1.1. GLOSSARY OF COMMON TERMS FOR OPENSHIFT CONTAINER

###### PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE

This glossary defines common terms that are used in the architecture content.

###### 1.2. ABOUT INSTALLATION AND UPDATES

As a cluster administrator, you can use the OpenShift Container Platform installation program to install
and deploy a cluster by using one of the following methods:

```
Installer-provisioned infrastructure
```
```
User-provisioned infrastructure
```
###### 1.3. ABOUT THE CONTROL PLANE

The control plane manages the worker nodes and the pods in your cluster. You can configure nodes with
the use of machine config pools (MCPs). MCPs are groups of machines, such as control plane
components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle. OpenShift Container
Platform assigns different roles to hosts. These roles define the function of a machine in a cluster. The
cluster contains definitions for the standard control plane and worker role types.

You can use Operators to package, deploy, and manage services on the control plane. Operators are
important components in OpenShift Container Platform because they provide the following services:

```
Perform health checks
```
```
Provide ways to watch applications
```
```
Manage over-the-air updates
```
```
Ensure applications stay in the specified state
```
###### 1.4. ABOUT CONTAINERIZED APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPERS

As a developer, you can use different tools, methods, and formats to develop your containerized
application based on your unique requirements, for example:

```
Use various build-tool, base-image, and registry options to build a simple container application.
```
```
Use supporting components such as OperatorHub and templates to develop your application.
```
```
Package and deploy your application as an Operator.
```
You can also create a Kubernetes manifest and store it in a Git repository. Kubernetes works on basic
units called pods. A pod is a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods can contain one or
more containers. You can create a service by grouping a set of pods and their access policies. Services

```
CHAPTER 1. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
```

```
provide permanent internal IP addresses and host names for other applications to use as pods are
created and destroyed. Kubernetes defines workloads based on the type of your application.
```
###### 1.5. ABOUT RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX COREOS (RHCOS) AND

###### IGNITION

```
As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)
tasks:
```
```
Learn about the next generation of single-purpose container operating system technology.
```
```
Choose how to configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)
```
```
Choose how to deploy Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS):
```
```
Installer-provisioned deployment
```
```
User-provisioned deployment
```
```
The OpenShift Container Platform installation program creates the Ignition configuration files that you
need to deploy your cluster. Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) uses Ignition during the initial
configuration to perform common disk tasks, such as partitioning, formatting, writing files, and
configuring users. During the first boot, Ignition reads its configuration from the installation media or the
location that you specify and applies the configuration to the machines.
```
```
You can learn how Ignition works, the process for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)
machine in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, view Ignition configuration files, and change
Ignition configuration after an installation.
```
###### 1.6. ABOUT ADMISSION PLUGINS

```
You can use admission plugins to regulate how OpenShift Container Platform functions. After a
resource request is authenticated and authorized, admission plugins intercept the resource request to
the master API to validate resource requests and to ensure that scaling policies are adhered to.
Admission plugins are used to enforce security policies, resource limitations, configuration requirements,
and other settings.
```

#### CHAPTER 2. OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM

#### ARCHITECTURE

###### 2.1. INTRODUCTION TO OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM

OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized applications. It is
designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few
machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology
that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other
applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized
applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

```
CHAPTER 2. OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE
```

```
2.1.1. About Kubernetes
```
```
Although container images and the containers that run from them are the primary building blocks for
modern application development, to run them at scale requires a reliable and flexible distribution system.
Kubernetes is the defacto standard for orchestrating containers.
```
```
Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and
management of containerized applications. The general concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:
```
```
Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


```
Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
```
```
Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra metadata with the
container and offers the ability to group several containers in a single deployment entity.
```
```
Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a set of pods and a
policy that defines how they are accessed. This policy allows containers to connect to the
services that they need even if they do not have the specific IP addresses for the services.
Replication controllers are another special asset that indicates how many pod replicas are
required to run at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application to
adapt to its current demand.
```
In only a few years, Kubernetes has seen massive cloud and on-premise adoption. The open source
development model allows many people to extend Kubernetes by implementing different technologies
for components such as networking, storage, and authentication.

2.1.2. The benefits of containerized applications

Using containerized applications offers many advantages over using traditional deployment methods.
Where applications were once expected to be installed on operating systems that included all their
dependencies, containers let an application carry their dependencies with them. Creating containerized
applications offers many benefits.

2.1.2.1. Operating system benefits

Containers use small, dedicated Linux operating systems without a kernel. Their file system, networking,
cgroups, process tables, and namespaces are separate from the host Linux system, but the containers
can integrate with the hosts seamlessly when necessary. Being based on Linux allows containers to use
all the advantages that come with the open source development model of rapid innovation.

Because each container uses a dedicated operating system, you can deploy applications that require
conflicting software dependencies on the same host. Each container carries its own dependent software
and manages its own interfaces, such as networking and file systems, so applications never need to
compete for those assets.

2.1.2.2. Deployment and scaling benefits

If you employ rolling upgrades between major releases of your application, you can continuously
improve your applications without downtime and still maintain compatibility with the current release.

You can also deploy and test a new version of an application alongside the existing version. If the
container passes your tests, simply deploy more new containers and remove the old ones.

Since all the software dependencies for an application are resolved within the container itself, you can
use a standardized operating system on each host in your data center. You do not need to configure a
specific operating system for each application host. When your data center needs more capacity, you
can deploy another generic host system.

Similarly, scaling containerized applications is simple. OpenShift Container Platform offers a simple,
standard way of scaling any containerized service. For example, if you build applications as a set of
microservices rather than large, monolithic applications, you can scale the individual microservices
individually to meet demand. This capability allows you to scale only the required services instead of the
entire application, which can allow you to meet application demands while using minimal resources.

2.1.3. OpenShift Container Platform overview

```
CHAPTER 2. OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE
```

```
OpenShift Container Platform provides enterprise-ready enhancements to Kubernetes, including the
following enhancements:
```
```
Hybrid cloud deployments. You can deploy OpenShift Container Platform clusters to a variety
of public cloud platforms or in your data center.
```
```
Integrated Red Hat technology. Major components in OpenShift Container Platform come from
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and related Red Hat technologies. OpenShift Container
Platform benefits from the intense testing and certification initiatives for Red Hat’s enterprise
quality software.
```
```
Open source development model. Development is completed in the open, and the source code
is available from public software repositories. This open collaboration fosters rapid innovation
and development.
```
```
Although Kubernetes excels at managing your applications, it does not specify or manage platform-level
requirements or deployment processes. Powerful and flexible platform management tools and
processes are important benefits that OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 offers. The following sections
describe some unique features and benefits of OpenShift Container Platform.
```
```
2.1.3.1. Custom operating system
```
```
OpenShift Container Platform uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), a container-oriented
operating system that is specifically designed for running containerized applications from OpenShift
Container Platform and works with new tools to provide fast installation, Operator-based management,
and simplified upgrades.
```
```
RHCOS includes:
```
```
Ignition, which OpenShift Container Platform uses as a firstboot system configuration for
initially bringing up and configuring machines.
```
```
CRI-O, a Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates closely with the
operating system to deliver an efficient and optimized Kubernetes experience. CRI-O provides
facilities for running, stopping, and restarting containers. It fully replaces the Docker Container
Engine, which was used in OpenShift Container Platform 3.
```
```
Kubelet, the primary node agent for Kubernetes that is responsible for launching and monitoring
containers.
```
```
In OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you must use RHCOS for all control plane machines, but you can
use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute machines, which are also
known as worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system
maintenance than if you use RHCOS for all of the cluster machines.
```
```
2.1.3.2. Simplified installation and update process
```
```
With OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, if you have an account with the right permissions, you can
deploy a production cluster in supported clouds by running a single command and providing a few values.
You can also customize your cloud installation or install your cluster in your data center if you use a
supported platform.
```
```
For clusters that use RHCOS for all machines, updating, or upgrading, OpenShift Container Platform is a
simple, highly-automated process. Because OpenShift Container Platform completely controls the
systems and services that run on each machine, including the operating system itself, from a central
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


control plane, upgrades are designed to become automatic events. If your cluster contains RHEL worker
machines, the control plane benefits from the streamlined update process, but you must perform more
tasks to upgrade the RHEL machines.

2.1.3.3. Other key features

Operators are both the fundamental unit of the OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 code base and a
convenient way to deploy applications and software components for your applications to use. In
OpenShift Container Platform, Operators serve as the platform foundation and remove the need for
manual upgrades of operating systems and control plane applications. OpenShift Container Platform
Operators such as the Cluster Version Operator and Machine Config Operator allow simplified, cluster-
wide management of those critical components.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and the OperatorHub provide facilities for storing and distributing
Operators to people developing and deploying applications.

The Red Hat Quay Container Registry is a Quay.io container registry that serves most of the container
images and Operators to OpenShift Container Platform clusters. Quay.io is a public registry version of
Red Hat Quay that stores millions of images and tags.

Other enhancements to Kubernetes in OpenShift Container Platform include improvements in software
defined networking (SDN), authentication, log aggregation, monitoring, and routing. OpenShift
Container Platform also offers a comprehensive web console and the custom OpenShift CLI ( **oc** )
interface.

2.1.3.4. OpenShift Container Platform lifecycle

The following figure illustrates the basic OpenShift Container Platform lifecycle:

```
Creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster
```
```
Managing the cluster
```
```
Developing and deploying applications
```
```
Scaling up applications
```
Figure 2.1. High level OpenShift Container Platform overview

2.1.4. Internet access for OpenShift Container Platform

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you require access to the internet to install your cluster.

```
CHAPTER 2. OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE
```

```
You must have internet access to:
```
```
Access OpenShift Cluster Manager to download the installation program and perform
subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry,
that service automatically entitles your cluster.
```
```
Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
```
```
Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.
```
```
IMPORTANT
```
```
If your cluster cannot have direct internet access, you can perform a restricted network
installation on some types of infrastructure that you provision. During that process, you
download the required content and use it to populate a mirror registry with the
installation packages. With some installation types, the environment that you install your
cluster in will not require internet access. Before you update the cluster, you update the
content of the mirror registry.
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


#### CHAPTER 3. INSTALLATION AND UPDATE

###### 3.1. ABOUT OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM INSTALLATION

The OpenShift Container Platform installation program offers four methods for deploying a cluster
which are detailed in the following list:

```
Interactive: You can deploy a cluster with the web-based Assisted Installer. This is an ideal
approach for clusters with networks connected to the internet. The Assisted Installer is the
easiest way to install OpenShift Container Platform, it provides smart defaults, and it performs
pre-flight validations before installing the cluster. It also provides a RESTful API for automation
and advanced configuration scenarios.
```
```
Local Agent-based: You can deploy a cluster locally with the Agent-based Installer for
disconnected environments or restricted networks. It provides many of the benefits of the
Assisted Installer, but you must download and configure the Agent-based Installer first.
Configuration is done with a command-line interface. This approach is ideal for disconnected
environments.
```
```
Automated: You can deploy a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure. The installation
program uses each cluster host’s baseboard management controller (BMC) for provisioning.
You can deploy clusters in connected or disconnected environments.
```
```
Full control: You can deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain, which
provides maximum customizability. You can deploy clusters in connected or disconnected
environments.
```
Each method deploys a cluster with the following characteristics:

```
Highly available infrastructure with no single points of failure, which is available by default.
```
```
Administrators can control what updates are applied and when.
```
3.1.1. About the installation program

You can use the installation program to deploy each type of cluster. The installation program generates
the main assets, such as Ignition config files for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines.
You can start an OpenShift Container Platform cluster with these three machine configurations,
provided you correctly configured the infrastructure.

The OpenShift Container Platform installation program uses a set of targets and dependencies to
manage cluster installations. The installation program has a set of targets that it must achieve, and each
target has a set of dependencies. Because each target is only concerned with its own dependencies, the
installation program can act to achieve multiple targets in parallel with the ultimate target being a
running cluster. The installation program recognizes and uses existing components instead of running
commands to create them again because the program meets the dependencies.

Figure 3.1. OpenShift Container Platform installation targets and dependencies

```
CHAPTER 3. INSTALLATION AND UPDATE
```

```
Figure 3.1. OpenShift Container Platform installation targets and dependencies
```
```
3.1.2. About Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)
```
```
Post-installation, each cluster machine uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the
operating system. RHCOS is the immutable container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
and features a RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHCOS includes the kubelet , which is the
Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes.
```
```
Every control plane machine in an OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster must use RHCOS, which
includes a critical first-boot provisioning tool called Ignition. This tool enables the cluster to configure
the machines. Operating system updates are delivered as a bootable container image, using OSTree as
a backend, that is deployed across the cluster by the Machine Config Operator. Actual operating system
changes are made in-place on each machine as an atomic operation by using rpm-ostree. Together,
these technologies enable OpenShift Container Platform to manage the operating system like it
manages any other application on the cluster, by in-place upgrades that keep the entire platform up to
date. These in-place updates can reduce the burden on operations teams.
```
```
If you use RHCOS as the operating system for all cluster machines, the cluster manages all aspects of its
components and machines, including the operating system. Because of this, only the installation
program and the Machine Config Operator can change machines. The installation program uses Ignition
config files to set the exact state of each machine, and the Machine Config Operator completes more
changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.
```
```
3.1.3. Supported platforms for OpenShift Container Platform clusters
```
```
In OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can install a cluster that uses installer-provisioned
infrastructure on the following platforms:
```
```
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


```
Bare metal
```
```
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
```
```
IBM Cloud®
```
```
Microsoft Azure
```
```
Microsoft Azure Stack Hub
```
```
Nutanix
```
```
Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)
```
```
The latest OpenShift Container Platform release supports both the latest RHOSP long-life
release and intermediate release. For complete RHOSP release compatibility, see the
OpenShift Container Platform on RHOSP support matrix.
```
```
VMware vSphere
```
For these clusters, all machines, including the computer that you run the installation process on, must
have direct internet access to pull images for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red
Hat.

```
IMPORTANT
```
```
After installation, the following changes are not supported:
```
```
Mixing cloud provider platforms.
```
```
Mixing cloud provider components. For example, using a persistent storage
framework from a another platform on the platform where you installed the
cluster.
```
In OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can install a cluster that uses user-provisioned infrastructure
on the following platforms:

```
AWS
```
```
Azure
```
```
Azure Stack Hub
```
```
Bare metal
```
```
GCP
```
```
IBM Power®
```
```
IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE
```
```
RHOSP
```
```
The latest OpenShift Container Platform release supports both the latest RHOSP long-life
release and intermediate release. For complete RHOSP release compatibility, see the
OpenShift Container Platform on RHOSP support matrix.
```
```
CHAPTER 3. INSTALLATION AND UPDATE
```

```
VMware Cloud on AWS
```
```
VMware vSphere
```
```
Depending on the supported cases for the platform, you can perform installations on user-provisioned
infrastructure, so that you can run machines with full internet access, place your cluster behind a proxy,
or perform a disconnected installation.
```
```
In a disconnected installation, you can download the images that are required to install a cluster, place
them in a mirror registry, and use that data to install your cluster. While you require internet access to
pull images for platform containers, with a disconnected installation on vSphere or bare metal
infrastructure, your cluster machines do not require direct internet access.
```
```
The OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations page contains details about integration
testing for different platforms.
```
```
3.1.4. Installation process
```
```
Except for the Assisted Installer, when you install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must
download the installation program from the appropriate Cluster Type page on the OpenShift Cluster
Manager Hybrid Cloud Console. This console manages:
```
```
REST API for accounts.
```
```
Registry tokens, which are the pull secrets that you use to obtain the required components.
```
```
Cluster registration, which associates the cluster identity to your Red Hat account to facilitate
the gathering of usage metrics.
```
```
In OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the installation program is a Go binary file that performs a series
of file transformations on a set of assets. The way you interact with the installation program differs
depending on your installation type. Consider the following installation use cases:
```
```
To deploy a cluster with the Assisted Installer, you must configure the cluster settings by using
the Assisted Installer. There is no installation program to download and configure. After you
finish setting the cluster configuration, you download a discovery ISO and then boot cluster
machines with that image. You can install clusters with the Assisted Installer on Nutanix,
vSphere, and bare metal with full integration, and other platforms without integration. If you
install on bare metal, you must provide all of the cluster infrastructure and resources, including
the networking, load balancing, storage, and individual cluster machines.
```
```
To deploy clusters with the Agent-based Installer, you can download the Agent-based Installer
first. You can then configure the cluster and generate a discovery image. You boot cluster
machines with the discovery image, which installs an agent that communicates with the
installation program and handles the provisioning for you instead of you interacting with the
installation program or setting up a provisioner machine yourself. You must provide all of the
cluster infrastructure and resources, including the networking, load balancing, storage, and
individual cluster machines. This approach is ideal for disconnected environments.
```
```
For clusters with installer-provisioned infrastructure, you delegate the infrastructure
bootstrapping and provisioning to the installation program instead of doing it yourself. The
installation program creates all of the networking, machines, and operating systems that are
required to support the cluster, except if you install on bare metal. If you install on bare metal,
you must provide all of the cluster infrastructure and resources, including the bootstrap
machine, networking, load balancing, storage, and individual cluster machines.
```
```
If you provision and manage the infrastructure for your cluster, you must provide all of the
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


```
If you provision and manage the infrastructure for your cluster, you must provide all of the
cluster infrastructure and resources, including the bootstrap machine, networking, load
balancing, storage, and individual cluster machines.
```
For the installation program, the program uses three sets of files during installation: an installation
configuration file that is named **install-config.yaml** , Kubernetes manifests, and Ignition config files for
your machine types.

```
IMPORTANT
```
```
You can modify Kubernetes and the Ignition config files that control the underlying
RHCOS operating system during installation. However, no validation is available to
confirm the suitability of any modifications that you make to these objects. If you modify
these objects, you might render your cluster non-functional. Because of this risk,
modifying Kubernetes and Ignition config files is not supported unless you are following
documented procedures or are instructed to do so by Red Hat support.
```
The installation configuration file is transformed into Kubernetes manifests, and then the manifests are
wrapped into Ignition config files. The installation program uses these Ignition config files to create the
cluster.

The installation configuration files are all pruned when you run the installation program, so be sure to
back up all the configuration files that you want to use again.

```
IMPORTANT
```
```
You cannot modify the parameters that you set during installation, but you can modify
many cluster attributes after installation.
```
The installation process with the Assisted Installer
Installation with the Assisted Installer involves creating a cluster configuration interactively by using the
web-based user interface or the RESTful API. The Assisted Installer user interface prompts you for
required values and provides reasonable default values for the remaining parameters, unless you change
them in the user interface or with the API. The Assisted Installer generates a discovery image, which you
download and use to boot the cluster machines. The image installs RHCOS and an agent, and the agent
handles the provisioning for you. You can install OpenShift Container Platform with the Assisted
Installer and full integration on Nutanix, vSphere, and bare metal. Additionally, you can install OpenShift
Container Platform with the Assisted Installer on other platforms without integration.

OpenShift Container Platform manages all aspects of the cluster, including the operating system itself.
Each machine boots with a configuration that references resources hosted in the cluster that it joins.
This configuration allows the cluster to manage itself as updates are applied.

If possible, use the Assisted Installer feature to avoid having to download and configure the Agent-
based Installer.

The installation process with Agent-based infrastructure
Agent-based installation is similar to using the Assisted Installer, except that you must initially download
and install the Agent-based Installer. An Agent-based installation is useful when you want the
convenience of the Assisted Installer, but you need to install a cluster in a disconnected environment.

If possible, use the Agent-based installation feature to avoid having to create a provisioner machine
with a bootstrap VM, and then provision and maintain the cluster infrastructure.

The installation process with installer-provisioned infrastructure

```
CHAPTER 3. INSTALLATION AND UPDATE
```

```
The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure. By default, the installation
program acts as an installation wizard, prompting you for values that it cannot determine on its own and
providing reasonable default values for the remaining parameters. You can also customize the
installation process to support advanced infrastructure scenarios. The installation program provisions
the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.
```
```
You can install either a standard cluster or a customized cluster. With a standard cluster, you provide
minimum details that are required to install the cluster. With a customized cluster, you can specify more
details about the platform, such as the number of machines that the control plane uses, the type of
virtual machine that the cluster deploys, or the CIDR range for the Kubernetes service network.
```
```
If possible, use this feature to avoid having to provision and maintain the cluster infrastructure. In all
other environments, you use the installation program to generate the assets that you require to
provision your cluster infrastructure.
```
```
With installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, OpenShift Container Platform manages all aspects of
the cluster, including the operating system itself. Each machine boots with a configuration that
references resources hosted in the cluster that it joins. This configuration allows the cluster to manage
itself as updates are applied.
```
```
The installation process with user-provisioned infrastructure
You can also install OpenShift Container Platform on infrastructure that you provide. You use the
installation program to generate the assets that you require to provision the cluster infrastructure,
create the cluster infrastructure, and then deploy the cluster to the infrastructure that you provided.
```
```
If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisioned, you must manage and
maintain the cluster resources yourself. The following list details some of these self-managed resources:
```
```
The underlying infrastructure for the control plane and compute machines that make up the
cluster
```
```
Load balancers
```
```
Cluster networking, including the DNS records and required subnets
```
```
Storage for the cluster infrastructure and applications
```
```
If your cluster uses user-provisioned infrastructure, you have the option of adding RHEL compute
machines to your cluster.
```
```
Installation process details
When a cluster is provisioned, each machine in the cluster requires information about the cluster.
OpenShift Container Platform uses a temporary bootstrap machine during initial configuration to
provide the required information to the permanent control plane. The temporary bootstrap machine
boots by using an Ignition config file that describes how to create the cluster. The bootstrap machine
creates the control plane machines that make up the control plane. The control plane machines then
create the compute machines, which are also known as worker machines. The following figure illustrates
this process:
```
```
Figure 3.2. Creating the bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


Figure 3.2. Creating the bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines

After the cluster machines initialize, the bootstrap machine is destroyed. All clusters use the bootstrap
process to initialize the cluster, but if you provision the infrastructure for your cluster, you must complete
many of the steps manually.

```
IMPORTANT
```
```
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain
certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the
cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later
restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the
expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the
pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover
kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control
plane certificates for more information.
```
```
Consider using Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated,
because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is
installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid
installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
```
Bootstrapping a cluster involves the following steps:

```
1. The bootstrap machine boots and starts hosting the remote resources required for the control
plane machines to boot. If you provision the infrastructure, this step requires manual
intervention.
```
```
2. The bootstrap machine starts a single-node etcd cluster and a temporary Kubernetes control
plane.
```
```
3. The control plane machines fetch the remote resources from the bootstrap machine and finish
booting. If you provision the infrastructure, this step requires manual intervention.
```
```
CHAPTER 3. INSTALLATION AND UPDATE
```

```
4. The temporary control plane schedules the production control plane to the production control
plane machines.
```
```
5. The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) comes online and installs the etcd Operator. The etcd
Operator scales up etcd on all control plane nodes.
```
```
6. The temporary control plane shuts down and passes control to the production control plane.
```
```
7. The bootstrap machine injects OpenShift Container Platform components into the production
control plane.
```
```
8. The installation program shuts down the bootstrap machine. If you provision the infrastructure,
this step requires manual intervention.
```
```
9. The control plane sets up the compute nodes.
```
```
10. The control plane installs additional services in the form of a set of Operators.
```
```
The result of this bootstrapping process is a running OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The cluster
then downloads and configures remaining components needed for the day-to-day operations, including
the creation of compute machines in supported environments.
```
```
Installation scope
The scope of the OpenShift Container Platform installation program is intentionally narrow. It is
designed for simplicity and ensured success. You can complete many more configuration tasks after
installation completes.
```
```
Additional resources

```
See Available cluster customizations for details about OpenShift Container Platform
configuration resources.
```
###### 3.2. ABOUT THE OPENSHIFT UPDATE SERVICE

```
The OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) provides update recommendations to OpenShift Container
Platform, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). It provides a graph, or diagram, that
contains the vertices of component Operators and the edges that connect them. The edges in the
graph show which versions you can safely update to. The vertices are update payloads that specify the
intended state of the managed cluster components.
```
```
The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) in your cluster checks with the OpenShift Update Service to see
the valid updates and update paths based on current component versions and information in the graph.
When you request an update, the CVO uses the corresponding release image to update your cluster.
The release artifacts are hosted in Quay as container images.
```
```
To allow the OpenShift Update Service to provide only compatible updates, a release verification
pipeline drives automation. Each release artifact is verified for compatibility with supported cloud
platforms and system architectures, as well as other component packages. After the pipeline confirms
the suitability of a release, the OpenShift Update Service notifies you that it is available.
```
```
IMPORTANT
```
```
The OpenShift Update Service displays all recommended updates for your current
cluster. If an update path is not recommended by the OpenShift Update Service, it might
be because of a known issue related to the update path, such as incompatibility or
availability.
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


Two controllers run during continuous update mode. The first controller continuously updates the
payload manifests, applies the manifests to the cluster, and outputs the controlled rollout status of the
Operators to indicate whether they are available, upgrading, or failed. The second controller polls the
OpenShift Update Service to determine if updates are available.

```
IMPORTANT
```
```
Only updating to a newer version is supported. Reverting or rolling back your cluster to a
previous version is not supported. If your update fails, contact Red Hat support.
```
During the update process, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) applies the new configuration to your
cluster machines. The MCO cordons the number of nodes specified by the **maxUnavailable** field on the
machine configuration pool and marks them unavailable. By default, this value is set to **1**. The MCO
updates the affected nodes alphabetically by zone, based on the **topology.kubernetes.io/zone** label. If
a zone has more than one node, the oldest nodes are updated first. For nodes that do not use zones,
such as in bare metal deployments, the nodes are updated by age, with the oldest nodes updated first.
The MCO updates the number of nodes as specified by the **maxUnavailable** field on the machine
configuration pool at a time. The MCO then applies the new configuration and reboots the machine.

```
WARNING
```
```
The default setting for maxUnavailable is 1 for all the machine config pools in
OpenShift Container Platform. It is recommended to not change this value and
update one control plane node at a time. Do not change this value to 3 for the
control plane pool.
```
If you use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machines as workers, the MCO does not update the kubelet
because you must update the OpenShift API on the machines first.

With the specification for the new version applied to the old kubelet, the RHEL machine cannot return
to the **Ready** state. You cannot complete the update until the machines are available. However, the
maximum number of unavailable nodes is set to ensure that normal cluster operations can continue with
that number of machines out of service.

The OpenShift Update Service is composed of an Operator and one or more application instances.

###### 3.3. SUPPORT POLICY FOR UNMANAGED OPERATORS

The _management state_ of an Operator determines whether an Operator is actively managing the
resources for its related component in the cluster as designed. If an Operator is set to an _unmanaged_
state, it does not respond to changes in configuration nor does it receive updates.

While this can be helpful in non-production clusters or during debugging, Operators in an unmanaged
state are unsupported and the cluster administrator assumes full control of the individual component
configurations and upgrades.

An Operator can be set to an unmanaged state using the following methods:

```
Individual Operator configuration
Individual Operators have a managementState parameter in their configuration. This can be
```
# 

```
CHAPTER 3. INSTALLATION AND UPDATE
```

```
accessed in different ways, depending on the Operator. For example, the Red Hat OpenShift
Logging Operator accomplishes this by modifying a custom resource (CR) that it manages,
while the Cluster Samples Operator uses a cluster-wide configuration resource.
```
```
Changing the managementState parameter to Unmanaged means that the Operator is not
actively managing its resources and will take no action related to the related component. Some
Operators might not support this management state as it might damage the cluster and require
manual recovery.
```
```
WARNING
```
```
Changing individual Operators to the Unmanaged state renders that
particular component and functionality unsupported. Reported issues must
be reproduced in Managed state for support to proceed.
```
```
Cluster Version Operator (CVO) overrides
The spec.overrides parameter can be added to the CVO’s configuration to allow
administrators to provide a list of overrides to the CVO’s behavior for a component. Setting the
spec.overrides[].unmanaged parameter to true for a component blocks cluster upgrades and
alerts the administrator after a CVO override has been set:
```
```
WARNING
```
```
Setting a CVO override puts the entire cluster in an unsupported state.
Reported issues must be reproduced after removing any overrides for
support to proceed.
```
###### 3.4. NEXT STEPS

#### CHAPTER 5. ABOUT THE MULTICLUSTER ENGINE FOR

#### KUBERNETES OPERATOR

One of the challenges of scaling Kubernetes environments is managing the lifecycle of a growing fleet.
To meet that challenge, you can use the multicluster engine Operator. The operator delivers full
lifecycle capabilities for managed ROSA clusters and partial lifecycle management for other Kubernetes
distributions. It is available in two ways:

```
As a standalone operator that you install as part of your ROSA or OpenShift Kubernetes Engine
subscription
```
```
As part of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes
```
###### 5.1. CLUSTER MANAGEMENT WITH MULTICLUSTER ENGINE ON ROSA

When you enable multicluster engine on ROSA, you gain the following capabilities:

```
Hosted control planes, which is a feature that is based on the HyperShift project. With a
centralized hosted control plane, you can operate ROSA clusters in a hyperscale manner.
```
```
Hive, which provisions self-managed ROSA clusters to the hub and completes the initial
configurations for those clusters.
```
```
klusterlet agent, which registers managed clusters to the hub.
```
```
Infrastructure Operator, which manages the deployment of the Assisted Service to orchestrate
on-premise bare metal and vSphere installations of ROSA, such as single-node OpenShift on
bare metal. The Infrastructure Operator includes GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), which
fully automates cluster creation on bare metal and vSphere provisioning with GitOps workflows
to manage deployments and configuration changes.
```
```
Open cluster management, which provides resources to manage Kubernetes clusters.
```
The multicluster engine is included with your ROSA support subscription and is delivered separately
from the core payload. To start to use multicluster engine, you deploy the ROSA cluster and then install
the operator. For more information, see Installing and upgrading multicluster engine operator.

###### 5.2. CLUSTER MANAGEMENT WITH RED HAT ADVANCED CLUSTER

###### MANAGEMENT

If you need cluster management capabilities beyond what ROSA with multicluster engine can provide,
consider Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. The multicluster engine is an integral part of Red Hat
Advanced Cluster Management and is enabled by default.

###### 5.3. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

For the complete documentation for multicluster engine, see Cluster lifecycle with multicluster engine
documentation, which is part of the product documentation for Red Hat Advanced Cluster
Management.

```
CHAPTER 5. ABOUT THE MULTICLUSTER ENGINE FOR KUBERNETES OPERATOR
```

#### CHAPTER 6. CONTROL PLANE ARCHITECTURE

```
The control plane , which is composed of control plane machines, manages the ROSA cluster. The control
plane machines manage workloads on the compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.
The cluster itself manages all upgrades to the machines by the actions of the Cluster Version Operator
(CVO), the Machine Config Operator, and a set of individual Operators.
```
###### 6.1. NODE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT WITH MACHINE CONFIG

###### POOLS

```
Machines that run control plane components or user workloads are divided into groups based on the
types of resources they handle. These groups of machines are called machine config pools (MCP). Each
MCP manages a set of nodes and its corresponding machine configs. The role of the node determines
which MCP it belongs to; the MCP governs nodes based on its assigned node role label. Nodes in an
MCP have the same configuration; this means nodes can be scaled up and torn down in response to
increased or decreased workloads.
```
```
By default, there are two MCPs created by the cluster when it is installed: master and worker. Each
default MCP has a defined configuration applied by the Machine Config Operator (MCO), which is
responsible for managing MCPs and facilitating MCP upgrades. You can create additional MCPs, or
custom pools, to manage nodes that have custom use cases that extend outside of the default node
types.
```
```
Custom pools are pools that inherit their configurations from the worker pool. They use any machine
config targeted for the worker pool, but add the ability to deploy changes only targeted at the custom
pool. Since a custom pool inherits its configuration from the worker pool, any change to the worker pool
is applied to the custom pool as well. Custom pools that do not inherit their configurations from the
worker pool are not supported by the MCO.
```
```
NOTE
```
```
A node can only be included in one MCP. If a node has multiple labels that correspond to
several MCPs, like worker,infra , it is managed by the infra custom pool, not the worker
pool. Custom pools take priority on selecting nodes to manage based on node labels;
nodes that do not belong to a custom pool are managed by the worker pool.
```
```
It is recommended to have a custom pool for every node role you want to manage in your cluster. For
example, if you create infra nodes to handle infra workloads, it is recommended to create a custom infra
MCP to group those nodes together. If you apply an infra role label to a worker node so it has the
worker,infra dual label, but do not have a custom infra MCP, the MCO considers it a worker node. If you
remove the worker label from a node and apply the infra label without grouping it in a custom pool, the
node is not recognized by the MCO and is unmanaged by the cluster.
```
```
IMPORTANT
```
```
Any node labeled with the infra role that is only running infra workloads is not counted
toward the total number of subscriptions. The MCP managing an infra node is mutually
exclusive from how the cluster determines subscription charges; tagging a node with the
appropriate infra role and using taints to prevent user workloads from being scheduled
on that node are the only requirements for avoiding subscription charges for infra
workloads.
```
```
The MCO applies updates for pools independently; for example, if there is an update that affects all
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


The MCO applies updates for pools independently; for example, if there is an update that affects all
pools, nodes from each pool update in parallel with each other. If you add a custom pool, nodes from
that pool also attempt to update concurrently with the master and worker nodes.

There might be situations where the configuration on a node does not fully match what the currently-
applied machine config specifies. This state is called _configuration drift_. The Machine Config Daemon
(MCD) regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift. If the MCD detects configuration drift, the
MCO marks the node **degraded** until an administrator corrects the node configuration. A degraded
node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated.

Additional resources

```
Understanding configuration drift detection
```
###### 6.2. MACHINE ROLES IN ROSA

ROSA assigns hosts different roles. These roles define the function of the machine within the cluster.
The cluster contains definitions for the standard **master** and **worker** role types.

```
NOTE
```
```
The cluster also contains the definition for the bootstrap role. Because the bootstrap
machine is used only during cluster installation, its function is explained in the cluster
installation documentation.
```
6.2.1. Control plane and node host compatibility

The ROSA version must match between control plane host and node host. For example, in a 4.16 cluster,
all control plane hosts must be 4.16 and all nodes must be 4.16.

Temporary mismatches during cluster upgrades are acceptable. For example, when upgrading from the
previous ROSA version to 4.16, some nodes will upgrade to 4.16 before others. Prolonged skewing of
control plane hosts and node hosts might expose older compute machines to bugs and missing features.
Users should resolve skewed control plane hosts and node hosts as soon as possible.

The **kubelet** service must not be newer than **kube-apiserver** , and can be up to two minor versions older
depending on whether your ROSA version is odd or even. The table below shows the appropriate
version compatibility:

```
ROSA version Supported kubelet skew
```
```
Odd ROSA minor versions [1] Up to one version older
```
```
Even ROSA minor versions [2] Up to two versions older
```
```
1. For example, ROSA 4.11, 4.13.
```
```
2. For example, ROSA 4.10, 4.12.
```
6.2.2. Cluster workers

In a Kubernetes cluster, worker nodes run and manage the actual workloads requested by Kubernetes

```
CHAPTER 6. CONTROL PLANE ARCHITECTURE
```

```
users. The worker nodes advertise their capacity and the scheduler, which is a control plane service,
determines on which nodes to start pods and containers. The following important services run on each
worker node:
```
```
CRI-O, which is the container engine.
```
```
kubelet, which is the service that accepts and fulfills requests for running and stopping container
workloads.
```
```
A service proxy, which manages communication for pods across workers.
```
```
The runC or crun low-level container runtime, which creates and runs containers.
```
```
NOTE
```
```
For information about how to enable crun instead of the default runC, see the
documentation for creating a ContainerRuntimeConfig CR.
```
```
In ROSA, compute machine sets control the compute machines, which are assigned the worker machine
role. Machines with the worker role drive compute workloads that are governed by a specific machine
pool that autoscales them. Because ROSA has the capacity to support multiple machine types, the
machines with the worker role are classed as compute machines. In this release, the terms worker
machine and compute machine are used interchangeably because the only default type of compute
machine is the worker machine. In future versions of ROSA, different types of compute machines, such
as infrastructure machines, might be used by default.
```
```
NOTE
```
```
Compute machine sets are groupings of compute machine resources under the
machine-api namespace. Compute machine sets are configurations that are designed to
start new compute machines on a specific cloud provider. Conversely, machine config
pools (MCPs) are part of the Machine Config Operator (MCO) namespace. An MCP is
used to group machines together so the MCO can manage their configurations and
facilitate their upgrades.
```
```
6.2.3. Cluster control planes
```
```
In a Kubernetes cluster, the master nodes run services that are required to control the Kubernetes
cluster. In ROSA, the control plane is comprised of control plane machines that have a master machine
role. They contain more than just the Kubernetes services for managing the ROSA cluster.
```
```
For most ROSA clusters, control plane machines are defined by a series of standalone machine API
resources. For supported cloud provider and ROSA version combinations, control planes can be
managed with control plane machine sets. Extra controls apply to control plane machines to prevent you
from deleting all of the control plane machines and breaking your cluster.
```
```
NOTE
```
```
Exactly three control plane nodes must be used for all production deployments.
```
```
Services that fall under the Kubernetes category on the control plane include the Kubernetes API server,
etcd, the Kubernetes controller manager, and the Kubernetes scheduler.
```
```
Table 6.1. Kubernetes services that run on the control plane
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


```
Component Description
```
```
Kubernetes API server The Kubernetes API server validates and configures the data for pods,
services, and replication controllers. It also provides a focal point for the
shared state of the cluster.
```
```
etcd etcd stores the persistent control plane state while other components
watch etcd for changes to bring themselves into the specified state.
```
```
Kubernetes controller manager The Kubernetes controller manager watches etcd for changes to objects
such as replication, namespace, and service account controller objects,
and then uses the API to enforce the specified state. Several such
processes create a cluster with one active leader at a time.
```
```
Kubernetes scheduler The Kubernetes scheduler watches for newly created pods without an
assigned node and selects the best node to host the pod.
```
There are also OpenShift services that run on the control plane, which include the OpenShift API server,
OpenShift controller manager, OpenShift OAuth API server, and OpenShift OAuth server.

Table 6.2. OpenShift services that run on the control plane

```
Component Description
```
```
OpenShift API server The OpenShift API server validates and configures the data for
OpenShift resources, such as projects, routes, and templates.
```
```
The OpenShift API server is managed by the OpenShift API Server
Operator.
```
```
OpenShift controller manager The OpenShift controller manager watches etcd for changes to
OpenShift objects, such as project, route, and template controller
objects, and then uses the API to enforce the specified state.
```
```
The OpenShift controller manager is managed by the OpenShift
Controller Manager Operator.
```
```
OpenShift OAuth API server The OpenShift OAuth API server validates and configures the data to
authenticate to ROSA, such as users, groups, and OAuth tokens.
```
```
The OpenShift OAuth API server is managed by the Cluster
Authentication Operator.
```
```
OpenShift OAuth server Users request tokens from the OpenShift OAuth server to authenticate
themselves to the API.
```
```
The OpenShift OAuth server is managed by the Cluster Authentication
Operator.
```
Some of these services on the control plane machines run as systemd services, while others run as static
pods.

```
CHAPTER 6. CONTROL PLANE ARCHITECTURE
```

```
Systemd services are appropriate for services that you need to always come up on that particular
system shortly after it starts. For control plane machines, those include sshd, which allows remote login.
It also includes services such as:
```
```
The CRI-O container engine (crio), which runs and manages the containers. ROSA 4.16 uses
CRI-O instead of the Docker Container Engine.
```
```
Kubelet (kubelet), which accepts requests for managing containers on the machine from control
plane services.
```
```
CRI-O and Kubelet must run directly on the host as systemd services because they need to be running
before you can run other containers.
```
```
The installer-* and revision-pruner-* control plane pods must run with root permissions because they
write to the /etc/kubernetes directory, which is owned by the root user. These pods are in the following
namespaces:
```
```
openshift-etcd
```
```
openshift-kube-apiserver
```
```
openshift-kube-controller-manager
```
```
openshift-kube-scheduler
```
###### 6.3. OPERATORS IN ROSA

```
Operators are among the most important components of ROSA. Operators are the preferred method of
packaging, deploying, and managing services on the control plane. They can also provide advantages to
applications that users run.
```
```
Operators integrate with Kubernetes APIs and CLI tools such as kubectl and oc commands. They
provide the means of monitoring applications, performing health checks, managing over-the-air (OTA)
updates, and ensuring that applications remain in your specified state.
```
```
Operators also offer a more granular configuration experience. You configure each component by
modifying the API that the Operator exposes instead of modifying a global configuration file.
```
```
Because CRI-O and the Kubelet run on every node, almost every other cluster function can be managed
on the control plane by using Operators. Components that are added to the control plane by using
Operators include critical networking and credential services.
```
```
While both follow similar Operator concepts and goals, Operators in ROSA are managed by two
different systems, depending on their purpose:
```
```
Cluster Operators, which are managed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO), are installed by
default to perform cluster functions.
```
```
Optional add-on Operators, which are managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), can be
made accessible for users to run in their applications.
```
```
6.3.1. Cluster Operators
```
```
In ROSA, all cluster functions are divided into a series of default cluster Operators. Cluster Operators
manage a particular area of cluster functionality, such as cluster-wide application logging, management
of the Kubernetes control plane, or the machine provisioning system.
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


Cluster Operators are represented by a **ClusterOperator** object, which cluster administrators can view in
the ROSA web console from the Administration → Cluster Settings page. Each cluster Operator
provides a simple API for determining cluster functionality. The Operator hides the details of managing
the lifecycle of that component. Operators can manage a single component or tens of components, but
the end goal is always to reduce operational burden by automating common actions.

Additional resources

```
Cluster Operators reference
```
6.3.2. Add-on Operators

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and OperatorHub are default components in ROSA that help
manage Kubernetes-native applications as Operators. Together they provide the system for discovering,
installing, and managing the optional add-on Operators available on the cluster.

Using OperatorHub in the ROSA web console, cluster administrators and authorized users can select
Operators to install from catalogs of Operators. After installing an Operator from OperatorHub, it can be
made available globally or in specific namespaces to run in user applications.

Default catalog sources are available that include Red Hat Operators, certified Operators, and
community Operators. Cluster administrators can also add their own custom catalog sources, which can
contain a custom set of Operators.

Developers can use the Operator SDK to help author custom Operators that take advantage of OLM
features, as well. Their Operator can then be bundled and added to a custom catalog source, which can
be added to a cluster and made available to users.

```
NOTE
```
```
OLM does not manage the cluster Operators that comprise the ROSA architecture.
```
Additional resources

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and OperatorHub.

```
###### 6.4. ABOUT THE MACHINE CONFIG OPERATOR

ROSA 4.16 integrates both operating system and cluster management. Because the cluster manages its
own updates, including updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) on cluster nodes, ROSA
provides an opinionated lifecycle management experience that simplifies the orchestration of node
upgrades.

ROSA employs three daemon sets and controllers to simplify node management. These daemon sets
orchestrate operating system updates and configuration changes to the hosts by using standard
Kubernetes-style constructs. They include:

```
The machine-config-controller , which coordinates machine upgrades from the control plane. It
monitors all of the cluster nodes and orchestrates their configuration updates.
```
```
The machine-config-daemon daemon set, which runs on each node in the cluster and updates
a machine to configuration as defined by machine config and as instructed by the
```
```
CHAPTER 6. CONTROL PLANE ARCHITECTURE
```

```
MachineConfigController. When the node detects a change, it drains off its pods, applies the
update, and reboots. These changes come in the form of Ignition configuration files that apply
the specified machine configuration and control kubelet configuration. The update itself is
delivered in a container. This process is key to the success of managing ROSA and RHCOS
updates together.
```
```
The machine-config-server daemon set, which provides the Ignition config files to control
plane nodes as they join the cluster.
```
```
The machine configuration is a subset of the Ignition configuration. The machine-config-daemon reads
the machine configuration to see if it needs to do an OSTree update or if it must apply a series of
systemd kubelet file changes, configuration changes, or other changes to the operating system or
ROSA configuration.
```
```
When you perform node management operations, you create or modify a KubeletConfig custom
resource (CR).
```
```
IMPORTANT
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


```
IMPORTANT
```
```
When changes are made to a machine configuration, the Machine Config Operator
(MCO) automatically reboots all corresponding nodes in order for the changes to take
effect.
```
```
You can mitigate the disruption caused by some machine config changes by using a node
disruption policy. See Understanding node restart behaviors after machine config changes.
```
```
Alternatively, you can prevent the nodes from automatically rebooting after machine
configuration changes before making the changes. Pause the autoreboot process by
setting the spec.paused field to true in the corresponding machine config pool. When
paused, machine configuration changes are not applied until you set the spec.paused
field to false and the nodes have rebooted into the new configuration.
```
```
The following modifications do not trigger a node reboot:
```
```
When the MCO detects any of the following changes, it applies the update
without draining or rebooting the node:
```
```
Changes to the SSH key in the
spec.config.passwd.users.sshAuthorizedKeys parameter of a machine
config.
```
```
Changes to the global pull secret or pull secret in the openshift-config
namespace.
```
```
Automatic rotation of the /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt certificate
authority (CA) by the Kubernetes API Server Operator.
```
```
When the MCO detects changes to the /etc/containers/registries.conf file, such
as adding or editing an ImageDigestMirrorSet , ImageTagMirrorSet , or
ImageContentSourcePolicy object, it drains the corresponding nodes, applies
the changes, and uncordons the nodes. The node drain does not happen for the
following changes:
```
```
The addition of a registry with the pull-from-mirror = "digest-only"
parameter set for each mirror.
```
```
The addition of a mirror with the pull-from-mirror = "digest-only"
parameter set in a registry.
```
```
The addition of items to the unqualified-search-registries list.
```
There might be situations where the configuration on a node does not fully match what the currently-
applied machine config specifies. This state is called _configuration drift_. The Machine Config Daemon
(MCD) regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift. If the MCD detects configuration drift, the
MCO marks the node **degraded** until an administrator corrects the node configuration. A degraded
node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated.

detection.

###### 6.5. OVERVIEW OF ETCD

```
etcd is a consistent, distributed key-value store that holds small amounts of data that can fit entirely in
memory. Although etcd is a core component of many projects, it is the primary data store for
Kubernetes, which is the standard system for container orchestration.
```
```
6.5.1. Benefits of using etcd
```
```
By using etcd, you can benefit in several ways:
```
```
Maintain consistent uptime for your cloud-native applications, and keep them working even if
individual servers fail
```
```
Store and replicate all cluster states for Kubernetes
```
```
Distribute configuration data to provide redundancy and resiliency for the configuration of
nodes
```
```
6.5.2. How etcd works
```
```
To ensure a reliable approach to cluster configuration and management, etcd uses the etcd Operator.
The Operator simplifies the use of etcd on a Kubernetes container platform like ROSA. With the etcd
Operator, you can create or delete etcd members, resize clusters, perform backups, and upgrade etcd.
```
```
The etcd Operator observes, analyzes, and acts:
```
```
1. It observes the cluster state by using the Kubernetes API.
```
```
2. It analyzes differences between the current state and the state that you want.
```
```
3. It fixes the differences through the etcd cluster management APIs, the Kubernetes API, or both.
```
```
etcd holds the cluster state, which is constantly updated. This state is continuously persisted, which
leads to a high number of small changes at high frequency. As a result, it is critical to back the etcd
cluster member with fast, low-latency I/O. For more information about best practices for etcd, see
"Recommended etcd practices".

###### 6.6. INTRODUCTION TO HOSTED CONTROL PLANES

```
You can use hosted control planes for Red Hat ROSA to reduce management costs, optimize cluster
deployment time, and separate management and workload concerns so that you can focus on your
applications.
```
```
Hosted control planes is available by using the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator version 2.0
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


Hosted control planes is available by using the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator version 2.0
or later on the following platforms:

```
Bare metal by using the Agent provider
```
```
OpenShift Virtualization, as a Generally Available feature in connected environments and a
Technology Preview feature in disconnected environments
```
```
Amazon Web Services (AWS), as a Technology Preview feature
```
```
IBM Z, as a Technology Preview feature
```
```
IBM Power, as a Technology Preview feature
```
6.6.1. Architecture of hosted control planes

ROSA is often deployed in a coupled, or standalone, model, where a cluster consists of a control plane
and a data plane. The control plane includes an API endpoint, a storage endpoint, a workload scheduler,
and an actuator that ensures state. The data plane includes compute, storage, and networking where
workloads and applications run.

The standalone control plane is hosted by a dedicated group of nodes, which can be physical or virtual,
with a minimum number to ensure quorum. The network stack is shared. Administrator access to a
cluster offers visibility into the cluster’s control plane, machine management APIs, and other
components that contribute to the state of a cluster.

Although the standalone model works well, some situations require an architecture where the control
plane and data plane are decoupled. In those cases, the data plane is on a separate network domain with
a dedicated physical hosting environment. The control plane is hosted by using high-level primitives
such as deployments and stateful sets that are native to Kubernetes. The control plane is treated as any
other workload.

```
CHAPTER 6. CONTROL PLANE ARCHITECTURE
```

```
6.6.2. Benefits of hosted control planes
```
```
With hosted control planes for ROSA, you can pave the way for a true hybrid-cloud approach and enjoy
several other benefits.
```
```
The security boundaries between management and workloads are stronger because the control
plane is decoupled and hosted on a dedicated hosting service cluster. As a result, you are less
likely to leak credentials for clusters to other users. Because infrastructure secret account
management is also decoupled, cluster infrastructure administrators cannot accidentally delete
control plane infrastructure.
```
```
With hosted control planes, you can run many control planes on fewer nodes. As a result,
clusters are more affordable.
```
```
Because the control planes consist of pods that are launched on ROSA, control planes start
quickly. The same principles apply to control planes and workloads, such as monitoring, logging,
and auto-scaling.
```
```
From an infrastructure perspective, you can push registries, HAProxy, cluster monitoring,
storage nodes, and other infrastructure components to the tenant’s cloud provider account,
isolating usage to the tenant.
```
```
From an operational perspective, multicluster management is more centralized, which results in
fewer external factors that affect the cluster status and consistency. Site reliability engineers
have a central place to debug issues and navigate to the cluster data plane, which can lead to
shorter Time to Resolution (TTR) and greater productivity.

6.6.3. Glossary of common concepts and personas for hosted control planes

When you use hosted control planes for ROSA, it is important to understand its key concepts and the
personas that are involved.

6.6.3.1. Concepts

hosted cluster

```
An ROSA cluster with its control plane and API endpoint hosted on a management cluster. The
hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane.
```
hosted cluster infrastructure

```
Network, compute, and storage resources that exist in the tenant or end-user cloud account.
```
hosted control plane

```
An ROSA control plane that runs on the management cluster, which is exposed by the API endpoint
of a hosted cluster. The components of a control plane include etcd, the Kubernetes API server, the
Kubernetes controller manager, and a VPN.
```
hosting cluster

```
See management cluster.
```
managed cluster

```
A cluster that the hub cluster manages. This term is specific to the cluster lifecycle that the
multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator manages in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. A
managed cluster is not the same thing as a management cluster. For more information, see Managed
cluster.
```
management cluster

```
An ROSA cluster where the HyperShift Operator is deployed and where the control planes for hosted
clusters are hosted. The management cluster is synonymous with the hosting cluster.
```
management cluster infrastructure

```
Network, compute, and storage resources of the management cluster.
```
node pool

```
A resource that contains the compute nodes. The control plane contains node pools. The compute
nodes run applications and workloads.
```
6.6.3.2. Personas

cluster instance administrator

```
Users who assume this role are the equivalent of administrators in standalone ROSA. This user has
the cluster-admin role in the provisioned cluster, but might not have power over when or how the
cluster is updated or configured. This user might have read-only access to see some configuration
projected into the cluster.
```
cluster instance user

```
Users who assume this role are the equivalent of developers in standalone ROSA. This user does not
have a view into OperatorHub or machines.
```
cluster service consumer

```
Users who assume this role can request control planes and worker nodes, drive updates, or modify
```
```
CHAPTER 6. CONTROL PLANE ARCHITECTURE
```

```
externalized configurations. Typically, this user does not manage or access cloud credentials or
infrastructure encryption keys. The cluster service consumer persona can request hosted clusters
and interact with node pools. Users who assume this role have RBAC to create, read, update, or
delete hosted clusters and node pools within a logical boundary.
cluster service provider
Users who assume this role typically have the cluster-admin role on the management cluster and
have RBAC to monitor and own the availability of the HyperShift Operator as well as the control
planes for the tenant’s hosted clusters. The cluster service provider persona is responsible for
several activities, including the following examples:
```
```
Owning service-level objects for control plane availability, uptime, and stability
```
```
Configuring the cloud account for the management cluster to host control planes
```
```
Configuring the user-provisioned infrastructure, which includes the host awareness of
available compute resources
```
```
6.6.4. Versioning for hosted control planes
```
```
With each major, minor, or patch version release of ROSA, two components of hosted control planes are
released:
```
```
The HyperShift Operator
```
```
The hcp command-line interface (CLI)
```
```
The HyperShift Operator manages the lifecycle of hosted clusters that are represented by the
HostedCluster API resources. The HyperShift Operator is released with each ROSA release. The
HyperShift Operator creates the supported-versions config map in the hypershift namespace. The
config map contains the supported hosted cluster versions.
```
```
You can host different versions of control planes on the same management cluster.
```
```
Example supported-versions config map object
```
```
You can use the hcp CLI to create hosted clusters.
```
```
You can use the hypershift.openshift.io API resources, such as, HostedCluster and NodePool , to
create and manage ROSA clusters at scale. A HostedCluster resource contains the control plane and
common data plane configuration. When you create a HostedCluster resource, you have a fully
functional control plane with no attached nodes. A NodePool resource is a scalable set of worker nodes
that is attached to a HostedCluster resource.
```
```
The API version policy generally aligns with the policy for Kubernetes API versioning.
```
```
apiVersion: v1
data:
supported-versions: '{"versions":["4.16"]}'
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
labels:
hypershift.openshift.io/supported-versions: "true"
name: supported-versions
namespace: hypershift
```

#### CHAPTER 7. NVIDIA GPU ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

NVIDIA supports the use of graphics processing unit (GPU) resources on ROSA. ROSA is a security-
focused and hardened Kubernetes platform developed and supported by Red Hat for deploying and
managing Kubernetes clusters at scale. ROSA includes enhancements to Kubernetes so that users can
easily configure and use NVIDIA GPU resources to accelerate workloads.

The NVIDIA GPU Operator leverages the Operator framework within ROSA to manage the full lifecycle
of NVIDIA software components required to run GPU-accelerated workloads.

These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), the Kubernetes device plugin for
GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, automatic node tagging using GPU feature discovery (GFD),
DCGM-based monitoring, and others.

```
NOTE
```
```
The NVIDIA GPU Operator is only supported by NVIDIA. For more information about
obtaining support from NVIDIA, see Obtaining Support from NVIDIA.
```
###### 7.1. NVIDIA GPU PREREQUISITES

```
A working OpenShift cluster with at least one GPU worker node.
```
```
Access to the OpenShift cluster as a cluster-admin to perform the required steps.
```
```
OpenShift CLI ( oc ) is installed.
```
```
The node feature discovery (NFD) Operator is installed and a nodefeaturediscovery instance
is created.

###### 7.2. NVIDIA GPU ENABLEMENT

The following diagram shows how the GPU architecture is enabled for OpenShift:

Figure 7.1. NVIDIA GPU enablement

```
CHAPTER 7. NVIDIA GPU ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
```

```
Figure 7.1. NVIDIA GPU enablement
```
```
NOTE
```
```
MIG is only supported with A30, A100, A100X, A800, AX800, H100, and H800.
```
```
7.2.1. GPUs and bare metal
```
```
You can deploy ROSA on an NVIDIA-certified bare metal server but with some limitations:
```
```
Control plane nodes can be CPU nodes.
```
```
Worker nodes must be GPU nodes, provided that AI/ML workloads are executed on these
worker nodes.
In addition, the worker nodes can host one or more GPUs, but they must be of the same type.
For example, a node can have two NVIDIA A100 GPUs, but a node with one A100 GPU and one
T4 GPU is not supported. The NVIDIA Device Plugin for Kubernetes does not support mixing
different GPU models on the same node.
```
```
When using OpenShift, note that one or three or more servers are required. Clusters with two
servers are not supported. The single server deployment is called single node openShift (SNO)
and using this configuration results in a non-high availability OpenShift environment.
```
```
You can choose one of the following methods to access the containerized GPUs:
```
```
GPU passthrough

7.2.2. GPUs and virtualization
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


Many developers and enterprises are moving to containerized applications and serverless
infrastructures, but there is still a lot of interest in developing and maintaining applications that run on
virtual machines (VMs). Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization provides this capability, enabling enterprises
to incorporate VMs into containerized workflows within clusters.

You can choose one of the following methods to connect the worker nodes to the GPUs:

```
GPU passthrough to access and use GPU hardware within a virtual machine (VM).
```
```
GPU (vGPU) time-slicing, when GPU compute capacity is not saturated by workloads.
```
Additional resources

```
NVIDIA GPU Operator with OpenShift Virtualization
```
7.2.3. GPUs and vSphere

You can deploy ROSA on an NVIDIA-certified VMware vSphere server that can host different GPU
types.

An NVIDIA GPU driver must be installed in the hypervisor in case vGPU instances are used by the VMs.
For VMware vSphere, this host driver is provided in the form of a VIB file.

The maximum number of vGPUS that can be allocated to worker node VMs depends on the version of
vSphere:

```
vSphere 7.0: maximum 4 vGPU per VM
```
```
vSphere 8.0: maximum 8 vGPU per VM
```
```
NOTE
```
```
vSphere 8.0 introduced support for multiple full or fractional heterogenous
profiles associated with a VM.
```
You can choose one of the following methods to attach the worker nodes to the GPUs:

```
GPU passthrough for accessing and using GPU hardware within a virtual machine (VM)
```
```
GPU (vGPU) time-slicing, when not all of the GPU is needed
```
Similar to bare metal deployments, one or three or more servers are required. Clusters with two servers
are not supported.

Additional resources

7.2.4. GPUs and Red Hat KVM

You can use ROSA on an NVIDIA-certified kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) server.

Similar to bare-metal deployments, one or three or more servers are required. Clusters with two servers
are not supported.

However, unlike bare-metal deployments, you can use different types of GPUs in the server. This is

```
CHAPTER 7. NVIDIA GPU ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
```

```
However, unlike bare-metal deployments, you can use different types of GPUs in the server. This is
because you can assign these GPUs to different VMs that act as Kubernetes nodes. The only limitation is
that a Kubernetes node must have the same set of GPU types at its own level.
```
```
You can choose one of the following methods to access the containerized GPUs:
```
```
GPU passthrough for accessing and using GPU hardware within a virtual machine (VM)
```
```
GPU (vGPU) time-slicing when not all of the GPU is needed
```
```
To enable the vGPU capability, a special driver must be installed at the host level. This driver is delivered
as a RPM package. This host driver is not required at all for GPU passthrough allocation.
```
```
Additional resources

```
How To Deploy OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 on KVM
```
```
7.2.5. GPUs and CSPs
```
```
You can deploy ROSA to one of the major cloud service providers (CSPs): Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.
```
```
Two modes of operation are available: a fully managed deployment and a self-managed deployment.
```
```
In a fully managed deployment, everything is automated by Red Hat in collaboration with CSP.
You can request an OpenShift instance through the CSP web console, and the cluster is
automatically created and fully managed by Red Hat. You do not have to worry about node
failures or errors in the environment. Red Hat is fully responsible for maintaining the uptime of
the cluster. The fully managed services are available on AWS and Azure. For AWS, the
OpenShift service is called ROSA (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS). For Azure, the service
is called Azure Red Hat OpenShift.
```
```
In a self-managed deployment, you are responsible for instantiating and maintaining the
OpenShift cluster. Red Hat provides the OpenShift-install utility to support the deployment of
the OpenShift cluster in this case. The self-managed services are available globally to all CSPs.
```
```
It is important that this compute instance is a GPU-accelerated compute instance and that the GPU
type matches the list of supported GPUs from NVIDIA AI Enterprise. For example, T4, V100, and A100
are part of this list.
```
```
You can choose one of the following methods to access the containerized GPUs:
```
```
GPU passthrough to access and use GPU hardware within a virtual machine (VM).
```
```
GPU (vGPU) time slicing when the entire GPU is not required.

Red Hat Device Edge provides access to MicroShift. MicroShift provides the simplicity of a single-node
deployment with the functionality and services you need for resource-constrained (edge) computing.
Red Hat Device Edge meets the needs of bare-metal, virtual, containerized, or Kubernetes workloads
deployed in resource-constrained environments.

###### 7.3. GPU SHARING METHODS

Red Hat and NVIDIA have developed GPU concurrency and sharing mechanisms to simplify GPU-
accelerated computing on an enterprise-level ROSA cluster.

Applications typically have different compute requirements that can leave GPUs underutilized.
Providing the right amount of compute resources for each workload is critical to reduce deployment
cost and maximize GPU utilization.

Concurrency mechanisms for improving GPU utilization exist that range from programming model APIs
to system software and hardware partitioning, including virtualization. The following list shows the GPU
concurrency mechanisms:

```
Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) streams
```
```
Time-slicing
```
```
CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS)
```
```
Multi-instance GPU (MIG)
```
```
Virtualization with vGPU
```
Consider the following GPU sharing suggestions when using the GPU concurrency mechanisms for
different ROSA scenarios:

Bare metal

```
vGPU is not available. Consider using MIG-enabled cards.
```
VMs

```
vGPU is the best choice.
```
Older NVIDIA cards with no MIG on bare metal

```
CHAPTER 7. NVIDIA GPU ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
```

```
Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a parallel computing platform and programming model
developed by NVIDIA for general computing on GPUs.
```
```
A stream is a sequence of operations that executes in issue-order on the GPU. CUDA commands are
typically executed sequentially in a default stream and a task does not start until a preceding task has
completed.
```
```
Asynchronous processing of operations across different streams allows for parallel execution of tasks. A
task issued in one stream runs before, during, or after another task is issued into another stream. This
allows the GPU to run multiple tasks simultaneously in no prescribed order, leading to improved
performance.
```

Asynchronous Concurrent Execution
```
```
7.3.2. Time-slicing
```
```
GPU time-slicing interleaves workloads scheduled on overloaded GPUs when you are running multiple
CUDA applications.
```
```
You can enable time-slicing of GPUs on Kubernetes by defining a set of replicas for a GPU, each of
which can be independently distributed to a pod to run workloads on. Unlike multi-instance GPU (MIG),
there is no memory or fault isolation between replicas, but for some workloads this is better than not
sharing at all. Internally, GPU time-slicing is used to multiplex workloads from replicas of the same
underlying GPU.
```
```
You can apply a cluster-wide default configuration for time-slicing. You can also apply node-specific
configurations. For example, you can apply a time-slicing configuration only to nodes with Tesla T4
GPUs and not modify nodes with other GPU models.
```
```
You can combine these two approaches by applying a cluster-wide default configuration and then
labeling nodes to give those nodes a node-specific configuration.
```
```
7.3.3. CUDA Multi-Process Service
```
```
CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS) allows a single GPU to use multiple CUDA processes. The
processes run in parallel on the GPU, eliminating saturation of the GPU compute resources. MPS also
enables concurrent execution, or overlapping, of kernel operations and memory copying from different
processes to enhance utilization.
```
```
Additional resources

```
7.3.4. Multi-instance GPU
```
```
Using Multi-instance GPU (MIG), you can split GPU compute units and memory into multiple MIG
instances. Each of these instances represents a standalone GPU device from a system perspective and
can be connected to any application, container, or virtual machine running on the node. The software
that uses the GPU treats each of these MIG instances as an individual GPU.
```
```
MIG is useful when you have an application that does not require the full power of an entire GPU. The
MIG feature of the new NVIDIA Ampere architecture enables you to split your hardware resources into
multiple GPU instances, each of which is available to the operating system as an independent CUDA-

enabled GPU.

NVIDIA GPU Operator version 1.7.0 and higher provides MIG support for the A100 and A30 Ampere
cards. These GPU instances are designed to support up to seven multiple independent CUDA
applications so that they operate completely isolated with dedicated hardware resources.

7.3.5. Virtualization with vGPU

Virtual machines (VMs) can directly access a single physical GPU using NVIDIA vGPU. You can create
virtual GPUs that can be shared by VMs across the enterprise and accessed by other devices.

This capability combines the power of GPU performance with the management and security benefits
provided by vGPU. Additional benefits provided by vGPU includes proactive management and
monitoring for your VM environment, workload balancing for mixed VDI and compute workloads, and
resource sharing across multiple VMs.

NVIDIA Container Toolkit enables you to create and run GPU-accelerated containers. The toolkit
includes a container runtime library and utilities to automatically configure containers to use NVIDIA
GPUs.
```
NVIDIA AI Enterprise

```
NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an end-to-end, cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software

```
```
ROSA on VMware vSphere with NVIDIA vGPU.
```
GPU Feature Discovery

```
NVIDIA GPU Feature Discovery for Kubernetes is a software component that enables you to
automatically generate labels for the GPUs available on a node. GPU Feature Discovery uses node
feature discovery (NFD) to perform this labeling.
The Node Feature Discovery Operator (NFD) manages the discovery of hardware features and
configurations in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster by labeling nodes with hardware-specific
information. NFD labels the host with node-specific attributes, such as PCI cards, kernel, OS version,
and so on.
```
```
You can find the NFD Operator in the Operator Hub by searching for “Node Feature Discovery”.

#### CHAPTER 8. UNDERSTANDING ROSA DEVELOPMENT

To fully leverage the capability of containers when developing and running enterprise-quality
applications, ensure your environment is supported by tools that allow containers to be:

```
Created as discrete microservices that can be connected to other containerized, and non-
containerized, services. For example, you might want to join your application with a database or
attach a monitoring application to it.
```
```
Resilient, so if a server crashes or needs to go down for maintenance or to be decommissioned,
containers can start on another machine.
```
```
Automated to pick up code changes automatically and then start and deploy new versions of
themselves.
```
```
Scaled up, or replicated, to have more instances serving clients as demand increases and then
spun down to fewer instances as demand declines.
```
```
Run in different ways, depending on the type of application. For example, one application might
run once a month to produce a report and then exit. Another application might need to run
constantly and be highly available to clients.
```
```
Managed so you can watch the state of your application and react when something goes wrong.
```
Containers’ widespread acceptance, and the resulting requirements for tools and methods to make
them enterprise-ready, resulted in many options for them.

The rest of this section explains options for assets you can create when you build and deploy
containerized Kubernetes applications in ROSA. It also describes which approaches you might use for
different kinds of applications and development requirements.

###### 8.1. ABOUT DEVELOPING CONTAINERIZED APPLICATIONS

You can approach application development with containers in many ways, and different approaches
might be more appropriate for different situations. To illustrate some of this variety, the series of
approaches that is presented starts with developing a single container and ultimately deploys that
container as a mission-critical application for a large enterprise. These approaches show different tools,
formats, and methods that you can employ with containerized application development. This topic
describes:

```
Building a simple container and storing it in a registry
```
```
Creating a Kubernetes manifest and saving it to a Git repository
```
```
Making an Operator to share your application with others
```
###### 8.2. BUILDING A SIMPLE CONTAINER

You have an idea for an application and you want to containerize it.

First you require a tool for building a container, like buildah or docker, and a file that describes what goes
in your container, which is typically a Dockerfile.

Next, you require a location to push the resulting container image so you can pull it to run anywhere you
want it to run. This location is a container registry.

```
CHAPTER 8. UNDERSTANDING ROSA DEVELOPMENT
```

```
Some examples of each of these components are installed by default on most Linux operating systems,
except for the Dockerfile, which you provide yourself.
```
```
The following diagram displays the process of building and pushing an image:
```
```
Figure 8.1. Create a simple containerized application and push it to a registry
```
```
If you use a computer that runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system, the process
of creating a containerized application requires the following steps:
```
```
1. Install container build tools: RHEL contains a set of tools that includes podman, buildah, and
skopeo that you use to build and manage containers.
```
```
2. Create a Dockerfile to combine base image and software: Information about building your
container goes into a file that is named Dockerfile. In that file, you identify the base image you
build from, the software packages you install, and the software you copy into the container. You
also identify parameter values like network ports that you expose outside the container and
volumes that you mount inside the container. Put your Dockerfile and the software you want to
containerize in a directory on your RHEL system.
```
```
3. Run buildah or docker build: Run the buildah build-using-dockerfile or the docker
build command to pull your chosen base image to the local system and create a container
image that is stored locally. You can also build container images without a Dockerfile by using
buildah.
```
```
4. Tag and push to a registry: Add a tag to your new container image that identifies the location of
the registry in which you want to store and share your container. Then push that image to the
registry by running the podman push or docker push command.
```
```
5. Pull and run the image: From any system that has a container client tool, such as podman or
docker, run a command that identifies your new image. For example, run the podman
run <image_name> or docker run <image_name> command. Here <image_name> is the
name of your new container image, which resembles quay.io/myrepo/myapp:latest. The
registry might require credentials to push and pull images.
```
```
For more details on the process of building container images, pushing them to registries, and running
them, see Custom image builds with Buildah.
```
```
8.2.1. Container build tool options
```
```
Building and managing containers with buildah, podman, and skopeo results in industry standard
container images that include features specifically tuned for deploying containers in ROSA or other
Kubernetes environments. These tools are daemonless and can run without root privileges, requiring
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


less overhead to run them.

```
IMPORTANT
```
```
Support for Docker Container Engine as a container runtime is deprecated in Kubernetes
1.20 and will be removed in a future release. However, Docker-produced images will
continue to work in your cluster with all runtimes, including CRI-O. For more information,
see the Kubernetes blog announcement.
```
When you ultimately run your containers in ROSA, you use the CRI-O container engine. CRI-O runs on
every worker and control plane machine in an ROSA cluster, but CRI-O is not yet supported as a
standalone runtime outside of ROSA.

8.2.2. Base image options

The base image you choose to build your application on contains a set of software that resembles a
Linux system to your application. When you build your own image, your software is placed into that file
system and sees that file system as though it were looking at its operating system. Choosing this base
image has major impact on how secure, efficient and upgradeable your container is in the future.

Red Hat provides a new set of base images referred to as Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI). These
images are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and are similar to base images that Red Hat has offered
in the past, with one major difference: they are freely redistributable without a Red Hat subscription. As
a result, you can build your application on UBI images without having to worry about how they are shared
or the need to create different images for different environments.

These UBI images have standard, init, and minimal versions. You can also use the Red Hat Software
Collections images as a foundation for applications that rely on specific runtime environments such as
Node.js, Perl, or Python. Special versions of some of these runtime base images are referred to as
Source-to-Image (S2I) images. With S2I images, you can insert your code into a base image
environment that is ready to run that code.

S2I images are available for you to use directly from the ROSA web UI. In the Developer perspective,
navigate to the +Add view and in the Developer Catalog tile, view all of the available services in the
Developer Catalog.

Figure 8.2. Choose S2I base images for apps that need specific runtimes

```
CHAPTER 8. UNDERSTANDING ROSA DEVELOPMENT
```

```
Figure 8.2. Choose S2I base images for apps that need specific runtimes
```
```
8.2.3. Registry options
```
```
Container registries are where you store container images so you can share them with others and make
them available to the platform where they ultimately run. You can select large, public container registries
that offer free accounts or a premium version that offer more storage and special features. You can also
install your own registry that can be exclusive to your organization or selectively shared with others.
```
```
To get Red Hat images and certified partner images, you can draw from the Red Hat Registry. The Red
Hat Registry is represented by two locations: registry.access.redhat.com , which is unauthenticated
and deprecated, and registry.redhat.io , which requires authentication. You can learn about the Red Hat
and partner images in the Red Hat Registry from the Container images section of the Red Hat
Ecosystem Catalog. Besides listing Red Hat container images, it also shows extensive information about
the contents and quality of those images, including health scores that are based on applied security
updates.
```
```
Large, public registries include Docker Hub and Quay.io. The Quay.io registry is owned and managed by
Red Hat. Many of the components used in ROSA are stored in Quay.io, including container images and
the Operators that are used to deploy ROSA itself. Quay.io also offers the means of storing other types
of content, including Helm charts.
```
```
If you want your own, private container registry, ROSA itself includes a private container registry that is
installed with ROSA and runs on its cluster. Red Hat also offers a private version of the Quay.io registry
called Red Hat Quay. Red Hat Quay includes geo replication, Git build triggers, Clair image scanning,
and many other features.
```
```
All of the registries mentioned here can require credentials to download images from those registries.
Some of those credentials are presented on a cluster-wide basis from ROSA, while other credentials can
be assigned to individuals.
```
###### 8.3. CREATING A KUBERNETES MANIFEST FOR ROSA

```
While the container image is the basic building block for a containerized application, more information is
required to manage and deploy that application in a Kubernetes environment such as ROSA. The typical
next steps after you create an image are to:
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


```
Understand the different resources you work with in Kubernetes manifests
```
```
Make some decisions about what kind of an application you are running
```
```
Gather supporting components
```
```
Create a manifest and store that manifest in a Git repository so you can store it in a source
versioning system, audit it, track it, promote and deploy it to the next environment, roll it back to
earlier versions, if necessary, and share it with others
```
8.3.1. About Kubernetes pods and services

While the container image is the basic unit with docker, the basic units that Kubernetes works with are
called pods. Pods represent the next step in building out an application. A pod can contain one or more
than one container. The key is that the pod is the single unit that you deploy, scale, and manage.

Scalability and namespaces are probably the main items to consider when determining what goes in a
pod. For ease of deployment, you might want to deploy a container in a pod and include its own logging
and monitoring container in the pod. Later, when you run the pod and need to scale up an additional
instance, those other containers are scaled up with it. For namespaces, containers in a pod share the
same network interfaces, shared storage volumes, and resource limitations, such as memory and CPU,
which makes it easier to manage the contents of the pod as a single unit. Containers in a pod can also
communicate with each other by using standard inter-process communications, such as System V
semaphores or POSIX shared memory.

While individual pods represent a scalable unit in Kubernetes, a service provides a means of grouping
together a set of pods to create a complete, stable application that can complete tasks such as load
balancing. A service is also more permanent than a pod because the service remains available from the
same IP address until you delete it. When the service is in use, it is requested by name and the ROSA
cluster resolves that name into the IP addresses and ports where you can reach the pods that compose
the service.

By their nature, containerized applications are separated from the operating systems where they run
and, by extension, their users. Part of your Kubernetes manifest describes how to expose the application
to internal and external networks by defining network policies that allow fine-grained control over
communication with your containerized applications. To connect incoming requests for HTTP, HTTPS,
and other services from outside your cluster to services inside your cluster, you can use an **Ingress**
resource.

If your container requires on-disk storage instead of database storage, which might be provided through
a service, you can add volumes to your manifests to make that storage available to your pods. You can
configure the manifests to create persistent volumes (PVs) or dynamically create volumes that are
added to your **Pod** definitions.

After you define a group of pods that compose your application, you can define those pods in
**Deployment** and **DeploymentConfig** objects.

8.3.2. Application types

Next, consider how your application type influences how to run it.

Kubernetes defines different types of workloads that are appropriate for different kinds of applications.
To determine the appropriate workload for your application, consider if the application is:

```
Meant to run to completion and be done. An example is an application that starts up to produce
a report and exits when the report is complete. The application might not run again then for a
```
```
CHAPTER 8. UNDERSTANDING ROSA DEVELOPMENT
```

```
month. Suitable ROSA objects for these types of applications include Job and
CronJob objects.
```
```
Expected to run continuously. For long-running applications, you can write a deployment.
```
```
Required to be highly available. If your application requires high availability, then you want to size
your deployment to have more than one instance. A Deployment or DeploymentConfig object
can incorporate a replica set for that type of application. With replica sets, pods run across
multiple nodes to make sure the application is always available, even if a worker goes down.
```
```
Need to run on every node. Some types of Kubernetes applications are intended to run in the
cluster itself on every master or worker node. DNS and monitoring applications are examples of
applications that need to run continuously on every node. You can run this type of application as
a daemon set. You can also run a daemon set on a subset of nodes, based on node labels.
```
```
Require life-cycle management. When you want to hand off your application so that others can
use it, consider creating an Operator. Operators let you build in intelligence, so it can handle
things like backups and upgrades automatically. Coupled with the Operator Lifecycle Manager
(OLM), cluster managers can expose Operators to selected namespaces so that users in the
cluster can run them.
```
```
Have identity or numbering requirements. An application might have identity requirements or
numbering requirements. For example, you might be required to run exactly three instances of
the application and to name the instances 0 , 1 , and 2. A stateful set is suitable for this
application. Stateful sets are most useful for applications that require independent storage, such
as databases and zookeeper clusters.
```
```
8.3.3. Available supporting components
```
```
The application you write might need supporting components, like a database or a logging component.
To fulfill that need, you might be able to obtain the required component from the following Catalogs
that are available in the ROSA web console:
```
```
OperatorHub, which is available in each ROSA 4.16 cluster. The OperatorHub makes Operators
available from Red Hat, certified Red Hat partners, and community members to the cluster
operator. The cluster operator can make those Operators available in all or selected
namespaces in the cluster, so developers can launch them and configure them with their
applications.
```
```
Templates, which are useful for a one-off type of application, where the lifecycle of a
component is not important after it is installed. A template provides an easy way to get started
developing a Kubernetes application with minimal overhead. A template can be a list of resource
definitions, which could be Deployment , Service , Route , or other objects. If you want to change
names or resources, you can set these values as parameters in the template.
```
```
You can configure the supporting Operators and templates to the specific needs of your development
team and then make them available in the namespaces in which your developers work. Many people add
shared templates to the openshift namespace because it is accessible from all other namespaces.
```
```
8.3.4. Applying the manifest
```
```
Kubernetes manifests let you create a more complete picture of the components that make up your
Kubernetes applications. You write these manifests as YAML files and deploy them by applying them to
the cluster, for example, by running the oc apply command.
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


8.3.5. Next steps

At this point, consider ways to automate your container development process. Ideally, you have some
sort of CI pipeline that builds the images and pushes them to a registry. In particular, a GitOps pipeline
integrates your container development with the Git repositories that you use to store the software that
is required to build your applications.

The workflow to this point might look like:

```
Day 1: You write some YAML. You then run the oc apply command to apply that YAML to the
cluster and test that it works.
```
```
Day 2: You put your YAML container configuration file into your own Git repository. From there,
people who want to install that app, or help you improve it, can pull down the YAML and apply it
to their cluster to run the app.
```
```
Day 3: Consider writing an Operator for your application.
```
###### 8.4. DEVELOP FOR OPERATORS

Packaging and deploying your application as an Operator might be preferred if you make your
application available for others to run. As noted earlier, Operators add a lifecycle component to your
application that acknowledges that the job of running an application is not complete as soon as it is
installed.

When you create an application as an Operator, you can build in your own knowledge of how to run and
maintain the application. You can build in features for upgrading the application, backing it up, scaling it,
or keeping track of its state. If you configure the application correctly, maintenance tasks, like updating
the Operator, can happen automatically and invisibly to the Operator’s users.

An example of a useful Operator is one that is set up to automatically back up data at particular times.
Having an Operator manage an application’s backup at set times can save a system administrator from
remembering to do it.

Any application maintenance that has traditionally been completed manually, like backing up data or
rotating certificates, can be completed automatically with an Operator.

#### CHAPTER 9. RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX COREOS (RHCOS)

###### 9.1. ABOUT RHCOS

```
Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) represents the next generation of single-purpose container
operating system technology by providing the quality standards of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
with automated, remote upgrade features.
```
```
RHCOS is supported only as a component of ROSA 4.16 for all ROSA machines. RHCOS is the only
supported operating system for ROSA control plane, or master, machines. While RHCOS is the default
operating system for all cluster machines, you can create compute machines, which are also known as
worker machines, that use RHEL as their operating system. There are two general ways RHCOS is
deployed in ROSA 4.16:
```
```
If you install your cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions, RHCOS
images are downloaded to the target platform during installation. Suitable Ignition config files,
which control the RHCOS configuration, are also downloaded and used to deploy the machines.
```
```
If you install your cluster on infrastructure that you manage, you must follow the installation
documentation to obtain the RHCOS images, generate Ignition config files, and use the Ignition
config files to provision your machines.
```
```
9.1.1. Key RHCOS features
```
```
The following list describes key features of the RHCOS operating system:
```
```
Based on RHEL: The underlying operating system consists primarily of RHEL components. The
same quality, security, and control measures that support RHEL also support RHCOS. For
example, RHCOS software is in RPM packages, and each RHCOS system starts up with a RHEL
kernel and a set of services that are managed by the systemd init system.
```
```
Controlled immutability: Although it contains RHEL components, RHCOS is designed to be
managed more tightly than a default RHEL installation. Management is performed remotely
from the ROSA cluster. When you set up your RHCOS machines, you can modify only a few
system settings. This controlled immutability allows ROSA to store the latest state of RHCOS
systems in the cluster so it is always able to create additional machines and perform updates
based on the latest RHCOS configurations.
```
```
CRI-O container runtime: Although RHCOS contains features for running the OCI- and
libcontainer-formatted containers that Docker requires, it incorporates the CRI-O container
engine instead of the Docker container engine. By focusing on features needed by Kubernetes
platforms, such as ROSA, CRI-O can offer specific compatibility with different Kubernetes
versions. CRI-O also offers a smaller footprint and reduced attack surface than is possible with
container engines that offer a larger feature set. At the moment, CRI-O is the only engine
available within ROSA clusters.
CRI-O can use either the runC or crun container runtime to start and manage containers. For
information about how to enable crun, see the documentation for creating a
ContainerRuntimeConfig CR.
```
```
Set of container tools: For tasks such as building, copying, and otherwise managing containers,
RHCOS replaces the Docker CLI tool with a compatible set of container tools. The podman CLI
tool supports many container runtime features, such as running, starting, stopping, listing, and
removing containers and container images. The skopeo CLI tool can copy, authenticate, and
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


```
sign images. You can use the crictl CLI tool to work with containers and pods from the CRI-O
container engine. While direct use of these tools in RHCOS is discouraged, you can use them for
debugging purposes.
```
```
rpm-ostree upgrades: RHCOS features transactional upgrades using the rpm-ostree system.
Updates are delivered by means of container images and are part of the ROSA update process.
When deployed, the container image is pulled, extracted, and written to disk, then the
bootloader is modified to boot into the new version. The machine will reboot into the update in a
rolling manner to ensure cluster capacity is minimally impacted.
```
```
bootupd firmware and bootloader updater: Package managers and hybrid systems such as
rpm-ostree do not update the firmware or the bootloader. With bootupd , RHCOS users have
access to a cross-distribution, system-agnostic update tool that manages firmware and boot
updates in UEFI and legacy BIOS boot modes that run on modern architectures, such as
x86_64, ppc64le, and aarch64.
For information about how to install bootupd , see the documentation for Updating the
bootloader using bootupd.
```
```
Updated through the Machine Config Operator: In ROSA, the Machine Config Operator
handles operating system upgrades. Instead of upgrading individual packages, as is done with
yum upgrades, rpm-ostree delivers upgrades of the OS as an atomic unit. The new OS
deployment is staged during upgrades and goes into effect on the next reboot. If something
goes wrong with the upgrade, a single rollback and reboot returns the system to the previous
state. RHCOS upgrades in ROSA are performed during cluster updates.
```
For RHCOS systems, the layout of the **rpm-ostree** file system has the following characteristics:

```
/usr is where the operating system binaries and libraries are stored and is read-only. We do not
support altering this.
```
```
/etc , /boot , /var are writable on the system but only intended to be altered by the Machine
Config Operator.
```
```
/var/lib/containers is the graph storage location for storing container images.
```
9.1.2. Choosing how to configure RHCOS

RHCOS is designed to deploy on an ROSA cluster with a minimal amount of user configuration. In its
most basic form, this consists of:

```
Starting with a provisioned infrastructure, such as on AWS, or provisioning the infrastructure
yourself.
```
```
Supplying a few pieces of information, such as credentials and cluster name, in an install-
config.yaml file when running openshift-install.
```
Because RHCOS systems in ROSA are designed to be fully managed from the ROSA cluster after that,
directly changing an RHCOS machine is discouraged. Although limited direct access to RHCOS
machines cluster can be accomplished for debugging purposes, you should not directly configure
RHCOS systems. Instead, if you need to add or change features on your ROSA nodes, consider making
changes in the following ways:

```
Kubernetes workload objects, such as DaemonSet and Deployment: If you need to add
services or other user-level features to your cluster, consider adding them as Kubernetes
workload objects. Keeping those features outside of specific node configurations is the best way
to reduce the risk of breaking the cluster on subsequent upgrades.
```
```
CHAPTER 9. RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX COREOS (RHCOS)
```

```
Day-2 customizations: If possible, bring up a cluster without making any customizations to
cluster nodes and make necessary node changes after the cluster is up. Those changes are
easier to track later and less likely to break updates. Creating machine configs or modifying
Operator custom resources are ways of making these customizations.
```
```
Day-1 customizations: For customizations that you must implement when the cluster first
comes up, there are ways of modifying your cluster so changes are implemented on first boot.
Day-1 customizations can be done through Ignition configs and manifest files during openshift-
install or by adding boot options during ISO installs provisioned by the user.
```
```
Here are examples of customizations you could do on day 1:
```
```
Kernel arguments: If particular kernel features or tuning is needed on nodes when the cluster
first boots.
```
```
Disk encryption: If your security needs require that the root file system on the nodes are
encrypted, such as with FIPS support.
```
```
Kernel modules: If a particular hardware device, such as a network card or video card, does not
have a usable module available by default in the Linux kernel.
```
```
Chronyd: If you want to provide specific clock settings to your nodes, such as the location of
time servers.
```
```
To accomplish these tasks, you can augment the openshift-install process to include additional objects
such as MachineConfig objects. Those procedures that result in creating machine configs can be
passed to the Machine Config Operator after the cluster is up.
```
```
NOTE
```
```
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain
certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the
cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later
restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the
expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the
pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover
kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control
plane certificates for more information.
```
```
It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are
generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the
cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid
installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
```
```
9.1.3. Choosing how to deploy RHCOS
```
```
Differences between RHCOS installations for ROSA are based on whether you are deploying on an
infrastructure provisioned by the installer or by the user:
```
```
Installer-provisioned: Some cloud environments offer preconfigured infrastructures that allow
you to bring up an ROSA cluster with minimal configuration. For these types of installations, you
can supply Ignition configs that place content on each node so it is there when the cluster first
boots.
```
```
User-provisioned: If you are provisioning your own infrastructure, you have more flexibility in
how you add content to a RHCOS node. For example, you could add kernel arguments when you
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


```
boot the RHCOS ISO installer to install each system. However, in most cases where
configuration is required on the operating system itself, it is best to provide that configuration
through an Ignition config.
```
The Ignition facility runs only when the RHCOS system is first set up. After that, Ignition configs can be
supplied later using the machine config.

9.1.4. About Ignition

Ignition is the utility that is used by RHCOS to manipulate disks during initial configuration. It completes
common disk tasks, including partitioning disks, formatting partitions, writing files, and configuring users.
On first boot, Ignition reads its configuration from the installation media or the location that you specify
and applies the configuration to the machines.

Whether you are installing your cluster or adding machines to it, Ignition always performs the initial
configuration of the ROSA cluster machines. Most of the actual system setup happens on each machine
itself. For each machine, Ignition takes the RHCOS image and boots the RHCOS kernel. Options on the
kernel command line identify the type of deployment and the location of the Ignition-enabled initial
RAM disk (initramfs).

9.1.4.1. How Ignition works

To create machines by using Ignition, you need Ignition config files. The ROSA installation program
creates the Ignition config files that you need to deploy your cluster. These files are based on the
information that you provide to the installation program directly or through an **install-config.yaml** file.

The way that Ignition configures machines is similar to how tools like cloud-init or Linux Anaconda
kickstart configure systems, but with some important differences:

```
Ignition runs from an initial RAM disk that is separate from the system you are installing to.
Because of that, Ignition can repartition disks, set up file systems, and perform other changes to
the machine’s permanent file system. In contrast, cloud-init runs as part of a machine init system
when the system boots, so making foundational changes to things like disk partitions cannot be
done as easily. With cloud-init, it is also difficult to reconfigure the boot process while you are in
the middle of the node boot process.
```
```
Ignition is meant to initialize systems, not change existing systems. After a machine initializes
and the kernel is running from the installed system, the Machine Config Operator from the
ROSA cluster completes all future machine configuration.
```
```
Instead of completing a defined set of actions, Ignition implements a declarative configuration.
It checks that all partitions, files, services, and other items are in place before the new machine
starts. It then makes the changes, like copying files to disk that are necessary for the new
machine to meet the specified configuration.
```
```
After Ignition finishes configuring a machine, the kernel keeps running but discards the initial
RAM disk and pivots to the installed system on disk. All of the new system services and other
features start without requiring a system reboot.
```
```
Because Ignition confirms that all new machines meet the declared configuration, you cannot
have a partially configured machine. If a machine setup fails, the initialization process does not
finish, and Ignition does not start the new machine. Your cluster will never contain partially
configured machines. If Ignition cannot complete, the machine is not added to the cluster. You
must add a new machine instead. This behavior prevents the difficult case of debugging a
machine when the results of a failed configuration task are not known until something that
depended on it fails at a later date.
```
```
CHAPTER 9. RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX COREOS (RHCOS)
```

```
If there is a problem with an Ignition config that causes the setup of a machine to fail, Ignition
will not try to use the same config to set up another machine. For example, a failure could result
from an Ignition config made up of a parent and child config that both want to create the same
file. A failure in such a case would prevent that Ignition config from being used again to set up an
other machines until the problem is resolved.
```
```
If you have multiple Ignition config files, you get a union of that set of configs. Because Ignition
is declarative, conflicts between the configs could cause Ignition to fail to set up the machine.
The order of information in those files does not matter. Ignition will sort and implement each
setting in ways that make the most sense. For example, if a file needs a directory several levels
deep, if another file needs a directory along that path, the later file is created first. Ignition sorts
and creates all files, directories, and links by depth.
```
```
Because Ignition can start with a completely empty hard disk, it can do something cloud-init
cannot do: set up systems on bare metal from scratch using features such as PXE boot. In the
bare metal case, the Ignition config is injected into the boot partition so that Ignition can find it
and configure the system correctly.
```
```
9.1.4.2. The Ignition sequence
```
```
The Ignition process for an RHCOS machine in an ROSA cluster involves the following steps:
```
```
The machine gets its Ignition config file. Control plane machines get their Ignition config files
from the bootstrap machine, and worker machines get Ignition config files from a control plane
machine.
```
```
Ignition creates disk partitions, file systems, directories, and links on the machine. It supports
RAID arrays but does not support LVM volumes.
```
```
Ignition mounts the root of the permanent file system to the /sysroot directory in the initramfs
and starts working in that /sysroot directory.
```
```
Ignition configures all defined file systems and sets them up to mount appropriately at runtime.
```
```
Ignition runs systemd temporary files to populate required files in the /var directory.
```
```
Ignition runs the Ignition config files to set up users, systemd unit files, and other configuration
files.
```
```
Ignition unmounts all components in the permanent system that were mounted in the initramfs.
```
```
Ignition starts up the init process of the new machine, which in turn starts up all other services on
the machine that run during system boot.
```
```
At the end of this process, the machine is ready to join the cluster and does not require a reboot.
```
###### 9.2. VIEWING IGNITION CONFIGURATION FILES

```
To see the Ignition config file used to deploy the bootstrap machine, run the following command:
```
```
After you answer a few questions, the bootstrap.ign , master.ign , and worker.ign files appear in the
directory you entered.
```
```
To see the contents of the bootstrap.ign file, pipe it through the jq filter. Here’s a snippet from that file:
```
```
$ openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir $HOME/testconfig
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


To decode the contents of a file listed in the **bootstrap.ign** file, pipe the base64-encoded data string
representing the contents of that file to the **base64 -d** command. Here’s an example using the contents
of the **/etc/motd** file added to the bootstrap machine from the output shown above:

CHAPTER 9. RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX COREOS (RHCOS)

```
Repeat those commands on the master.ign and worker.ign files to see the source of Ignition config
files for each of those machine types. You should see a line like the following for the worker.ign ,
identifying how it gets its Ignition config from the bootstrap machine:
```
```
Here are a few things you can learn from the bootstrap.ign file:
```
```
Format: The format of the file is defined in the Ignition config spec. Files of the same format are
used later by the MCO to merge changes into a machine’s configuration.
```
```
Contents: Because the bootstrap machine serves the Ignition configs for other machines, both
master and worker machine Ignition config information is stored in the bootstrap.ign , along with
the bootstrap machine’s configuration.
```
```
Size: The file is more than 1300 lines long, with path to various types of resources.
```
```
The content of each file that will be copied to the machine is actually encoded into data URLs,
which tends to make the content a bit clumsy to read. (Use the jq and base64 commands shown
previously to make the content more readable.)
```
```
Configuration: The different sections of the Ignition config file are generally meant to contain
files that are just dropped into a machine’s file system, rather than commands to modify existing
files. For example, instead of having a section on NFS that configures that service, you would
just add an NFS configuration file, which would then be started by the init process when the
system comes up.
```
```
users: A user named core is created, with your SSH key assigned to that user. This allows you to
log in to the cluster with that user name and your credentials.
```
```
storage: The storage section identifies files that are added to each machine. A few notable files
include /root/.docker/config.json (which provides credentials your cluster needs to pull from
container image registries) and a bunch of manifest files in /opt/openshift/manifests that are
used to configure your cluster.
```
```
systemd: The systemd section holds content used to create systemd unit files. Those files are
used to start up services at boot time, as well as manage those services on running systems.
```
```
Primitives: Ignition also exposes low-level primitives that other tools can build on.
```
###### 9.3. CHANGING IGNITION CONFIGS AFTER INSTALLATION

```
Machine config pools manage a cluster of nodes and their corresponding machine configs. Machine
configs contain configuration information for a cluster. To list all machine config pools that are known:
```
```
Example output
```
```
run e.g.
```
```
journalctl -b -f -u release-image.service -u bootkube.service
```
```
"source": "https://api.myign.develcluster.example.com:22623/config/worker",
```
```
$ oc get machineconfigpools
```
OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Architecture


To list all machine configs:

Example output

The Machine Config Operator acts somewhat differently than Ignition when it comes to applying these
machine configs. The machine configs are read in order (from 00* to 99*). Labels inside the machine
configs identify the type of node each is for (master or worker). If the same file appears in multiple
machine config files, the last one wins. So, for example, any file that appears in a 99* file would replace
the same file that appeared in a 00* file. The input **MachineConfig** objects are unioned into a
"rendered" **MachineConfig** object, which will be used as a target by the operator and is the value you
can see in the machine config pool.

To see what files are being managed from a machine config, look for "Path:" inside a particular
**MachineConfig** object. For example:

Example output

Be sure to give the machine config file a later name (such as 10-worker-container-runtime). Keep in
mind that the content of each file is in URL-style data. Then apply the new machine config to the
cluster.

#### CHAPTER 10. ADMISSION PLUGINS

```
Admission plugins are used to help regulate how ROSA functions.
```
###### 10.1. ABOUT ADMISSION PLUGINS

```
Admission plugins intercept requests to the master API to validate resource requests. After a request is
authenticated and authorized, the admission plugins ensure that any associated policies are followed.
For example, they are commonly used to enforce security policy, resource limitations or configuration
requirements.
```
```
Admission plugins run in sequence as an admission chain. If any admission plugin in the sequence rejects
a request, the whole chain is aborted and an error is returned.
```
```
ROSA has a default set of admission plugins enabled for each resource type. These are required for
proper functioning of the cluster. Admission plugins ignore resources that they are not responsible for.
```
```
In addition to the defaults, the admission chain can be extended dynamically through webhook
admission plugins that call out to custom webhook servers. There are two types of webhook admission
plugins: a mutating admission plugin and a validating admission plugin. The mutating admission plugin
runs first and can both modify resources and validate requests. The validating admission plugin validates
requests and runs after the mutating admission plugin so that modifications triggered by the mutating
admission plugin can also be validated.
```
```
Calling webhook servers through a mutating admission plugin can produce side effects on resources
related to the target object. In such situations, you must take steps to validate that the end result is as
expected.
```
```
WARNING
```
```
Dynamic admission should be used cautiously because it impacts cluster control
plane operations. When calling webhook servers through webhook admission
plugins in ROSA 4.16, ensure that you have read the documentation fully and tested
for side effects of mutations. Include steps to restore resources back to their
original state prior to mutation, in the event that a request does not pass through
the entire admission chain.
```
###### 10.2. DEFAULT ADMISSION PLUGINS

```
Default validating and admission plugins are enabled in ROSA 4.16. These default plugins contribute to
fundamental control plane functionality, such as ingress policy, cluster resource limit override and quota
policy.
```
```
IMPORTANT

###### 10.3. WEBHOOK ADMISSION PLUGINS

In addition to ROSA default admission plugins, dynamic admission can be implemented through
webhook admission plugins that call webhook servers, to extend the functionality of the admission chain.
Webhook servers are called over HTTP at defined endpoints.

There are two types of webhook admission plugins in ROSA:

```
During the admission process, the mutating admission plugin can perform tasks, such as injecting
affinity labels.
```
```
At the end of the admission process, the validating admission plugin can be used to make sure an
object is configured properly, for example ensuring affinity labels are as expected. If the
validation passes, ROSA schedules the object as configured.
```
When an API request comes in, mutating or validating admission plugins use the list of external
webhooks in the configuration and call them in parallel:

```
If all of the webhooks approve the request, the admission chain continues.
```
```
If any of the webhooks deny the request, the admission request is denied and the reason for
doing so is based on the first denial.
```
```
If more than one webhook denies the admission request, only the first denial reason is returned
to the user.
```
```
If an error is encountered when calling a webhook, the request is either denied or the webhook is
ignored depending on the error policy set. If the error policy is set to Ignore , the request is
unconditionally accepted in the event of a failure. If the policy is set to Fail , failed requests are
denied. Using Ignore can result in unpredictable behavior for all clients.
```
Communication between the webhook admission plugin and the webhook server must use TLS.
Generate a CA certificate and use the certificate to sign the server certificate that is used by your
webhook admission server. The PEM-encoded CA certificate is supplied to the webhook admission
plugin using a mechanism, such as service serving certificate secrets.

The following diagram illustrates the sequential admission chain process within which multiple webhook
servers are called.

Figure 10.1. API admission chain with mutating and validating admission plugins

```
CHAPTER 10. ADMISSION PLUGINS
```

```
Figure 10.1. API admission chain with mutating and validating admission plugins
```
```
An example webhook admission plugin use case is where all pods must have a common set of labels. In
this example, the mutating admission plugin can inject labels and the validating admission plugin can
check that labels are as expected. ROSA would subsequently schedule pods that include required labels
and reject those that do not.
```
```
Some common webhook admission plugin use cases include:
```
```
Namespace reservation.
```
```
Limiting custom network resources managed by the SR-IOV network device plugin.
```
```
Defining tolerations that enable taints to qualify which pods should be scheduled on a node.
```
```
Pod priority class validation.
```
```
NOTE
```
```
The maximum default webhook timeout value in ROSA is 13 seconds, and it cannot be
changed.
```
###### 10.4. TYPES OF WEBHOOK ADMISSION PLUGINS

```
Cluster administrators can call out to webhook servers through the mutating admission plugin or the
validating admission plugin in the API server admission chain.
```
```
10.4.1. Mutating admission plugin
```
```
The mutating admission plugin is invoked during the mutation phase of the admission process, which
allows modification of resource content before it is persisted. One example webhook that can be called
through the mutating admission plugin is the Pod Node Selector feature, which uses an annotation on a
namespace to find a label selector and add it to the pod specification.

```
10.4.2. Validating admission plugin
```
```
A validating admission plugin is invoked during the validation phase of the admission process. This phase
allows the enforcement of invariants on particular API resources to ensure that the resource does not
change again. The Pod Node Selector is also an example of a webhook which is called by the validating
admission plugin, to ensure that all nodeSelector fields are constrained by the node selector
restrictions on the namespace.

Specifies how the policy should proceed if the webhook server is unavailable. Replace <policy>
with either Ignore (to unconditionally accept the request in the event of a failure) or Fail (to deny
the failed request). Using Ignore can result in unpredictable behavior for all clients.
```
###### 10.5. CONFIGURING DYNAMIC ADMISSION

```
This procedure outlines high-level steps to configure dynamic admission. The functionality of the
admission chain is extended by configuring a webhook admission plugin to call out to a webhook server.
```
```
The webhook server is also configured as an aggregated API server. This allows other ROSA
components to communicate with the webhook using internal credentials and facilitates testing using
the oc command. Additionally, this enables role based access control (RBAC) into the webhook and
prevents token information from other API servers from being disclosed to the webhook.
```
```
Prerequisites
```
```
An ROSA account with cluster administrator access.
```
```
The ROSA CLI ( oc ) installed.
```
```
A published webhook server container image.
```
```
Procedure
```
```
1. Build a webhook server container image and make it available to the cluster using an image
registry.
```
```
2. Create a local CA key and certificate and use them to sign the webhook server’s certificate
signing request (CSR).
```
```
3. Create a new project for webhook resources:
```
```
Note that the webhook server might expect a specific name.
```
```
4. Define RBAC rules for the aggregated API service in a file called rbac.yaml :
```
```
$ oc new-project my-webhook-namespace 1
```
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: List
items:
```
```

6. Create a YAML file called webhook-daemonset.yaml that is used to deploy a webhook as a
daemon set server in a namespace:
```
```
$ oc auth reconcile -f rbac.yaml
```
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet

7. Deploy the daemon set:
```
```
8. Define a secret for the service serving certificate signer, within a YAML file called webhook-
secret.yaml :
```
```
References the signed webhook server certificate. Replace <server_certificate> with the
appropriate certificate in base64 format.
```
```
References the signed webhook server key. Replace <server_key> with the appropriate
key in base64 format.
```
```
9. Create the secret:
```
10. Define a service account and service, within a YAML file called **webhook-service.yaml** :

```
$ oc apply -f webhook-daemonset.yaml
```
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
namespace: my-webhook-namespace
name: server-serving-cert
type: kubernetes.io/tls

```
11. Expose the webhook server within the cluster:
```
```
12. Define a custom resource definition for the webhook server, in a file called webhook-crd.yaml :
```
```
Reflects CustomResourceDefinition spec values and is in the format <plural>.<group>.
This example uses the namespacereservations resource.
```
```
REST API group name.
```
```
REST API version name.
```
```
Accepted values are Namespaced or Cluster.
```
```
Plural name to be included in URL.
```
```
Alias seen in oc output.
```
```
The reference for resource manifests.
```
```
13. Apply the custom resource definition:
```
```
metadata:
namespace: my-webhook-namespace
name: server
annotations:
service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: server-serving-cert
spec:
selector:
server: "true"
ports:
```
- port: 443 **1**
targetPort: 8443 **2**

```
$ oc apply -f webhook-service.yaml
```
```

14. Configure the webhook server also as an aggregated API server, within a file called **webhook-
api-service.yaml** :

```
A PEM-encoded CA certificate that signs the server certificate that is used by the
webhook server. Replace <ca_signing_certificate> with the appropriate certificate in
base64 format.
```
15. Deploy the aggregated API service:

16. Define the webhook admission plugin configuration within a file called **webhook-config.yaml**.
This example uses the validating admission plugin:

```
$ oc apply -f webhook-crd.yaml
```
```
apiVersion: apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: APIService
metadata:
name: v1beta1.admission.online.openshift.io

```
```
$ oc apply -f webhook-api-service.yaml
```
```
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
name: namespacereservations.admission.online.openshift.io 1
webhooks:
```

18. Verify that the webhook is functioning as expected. For example, if you have configured
dynamic admission to reserve specific namespaces, confirm that requests to create those
namespaces are rejected and that requests to create non-reserved namespaces succeed.
